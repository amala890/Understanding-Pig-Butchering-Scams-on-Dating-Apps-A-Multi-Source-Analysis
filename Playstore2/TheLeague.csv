Here's why: 1) This app is a ghost town. Nobody really uses the app, because nobody uses the app, because nobody uses it, etc. Matches very rarely lead to meaningful conversations -- nothing ever goes anywhere. I have over 200 matches on Hinge & overall the experience is way better. People won't respond to you because they've gotten tired of the app, and are looking elsewhere. By the time they look back at the app, it's been a week. Maybe they'll message you, but by the time you see their message, it's been another week. Things fizzle out. The problem is an engagement death spiral. You get very few ""prospects"" per day. The matchmaking algorithm is very bad at showing you people that are mutually compatible. Why? Probably the main reason is that because there are so few prospects, there is very little data for the algorithm to show you good matches. These kinds of algorithms need a lot of data to be accurate. Because the matches are bad, people don't really use the app because they're disappointed, so the algorithm has even less data to give you good matches, and so on. The idea of a having a few ""prospects"" a day sounds great, but in execution is a failure. The format is incredibly dry, which makes it hard to start a conversation. All of the side events, and other feature are also complete failures not even worth discussing. 2) This app is not exclusive. There's literally no difference between the people I see in this app and others. I often see the same profile in both. This is not an app for ""elite singles"". Unless you consider primary school teachers and dancers as ""elite"" -- if that's something important to you. ""Elite dating"" does exist, but it costs $5000-$20,000 and comes from matchmakers, who are also likely to be scammers. The League is selling you something it cannot provide. Think about it. How can an app be freemium, and also exclusive? When you make something exclusive, that means a small percentage of people are using it. And if it's freemium, that means an even smaller number of people paying money. So how can this app be freemium, and elite, and also not go bankrupt? Well here's how: 3) Its paid version is a scam. I wasn't dumb enough to pay for this. There are literally hundreds of other reviews that will explain how this is a waste of money, so I will leave it to others. Don't pay to get off the wait list. Just sign up and after a few weeks, they'll let you in. If they didn't do this, the could never be profitable. A small percentage of people are impatient, and will pay believing that this app is exclusive. It may take them a few months to realize that they're wasting their money, and I'm pretty sure that's the entire business model of the company. Is there any other way in which this app could fail? There is literally no reason to download this app. Download Hinged and The League and use both. I will pay you $1000 if you get a date on The League before you get a date on Hinged.",1,49,1.17.773,2020-06-15 04:17:47,"Hi Robert, Thank you for taking the time out of your day to write a review about our App. We truly appreciate all reviews.

In regards to the developer's response, I have matched with far more people on Tinder, Bumble, and OkCupid without changing my preferences or standards.

to improve your profile. Anyway, after maybe a month I got my first match.

professional, quality people of substance that any guy should be proud to

stay on it, and they reward your activity- logging in regularly, being the 
first to initiate communication, response time, etc.- with boosting your 
profile and giving you more possible matches. Yet there are still users who 
will get a match and neither initiate conversation nor respond. Of course, 
this is not really something the app can be responsible for, but it is 
still a disappointment. One major disappointment the app creators are 
responsible for, is how easy it is to accidentally x out a match, and how 
much they charge you to undo it. There is no ""are you sure"" popup when you 
x a match, making the app feel a lot more like tinder than a higher-quality 
matchmaking app. That image is further enhanced when you figure out that 
the app's currency - tickets- cannot be earned in any way, cannot be 
purchased in single quantities, and are not available at a reasonable price 
(it's $25 for FIVE). In my opinion, as a serious user of the app who 
doesn't have a disposable income to waste on something as impossible to 
guarantee as a dating app, this issue alone- the ease of accidentally 
skipping a match combined with the unrealistic cost of undoing such a 
mistake- is a major flaw and I sincerely hope they fix it.",2,0,1.14.14,2018-05-24 13:13:17,"Hi Alicia, thanks for the feedback!

(I won't use those words because that's a stupid way to phrase it, but you get the idea.)  Apparently, this app does well enough at filtering people that this sort  self-description appeals to a lot of the users relative to other apps.

Business; 2. Social/dating expertise 3. Tech expertise. The developers here only have 1 out of the 3. They seem to have the tech part down... But they don't have a clue about business, the needs and concerns of consumers, consumer behavior or how to launch a venture. They are also clueless about dating culture and how humans interact. Whether or not the tech piece is solid enough is even questionable at this point. This is why it is faultering. Cherrypicking which cities are even allowed to participate was a huge mistake. I was shocked to learn (when I discovered the app about a year ago) that it waa only in a small handful of cities. I am frustrated to no end with low quality dating sites with no vetting...and would be happy to pay $100...$150 and an annual fee of $100 (give or take a few bucks) thereafter. And i'm sure there are thousands more like me.... but they won't let us in...because we aren't on the list of their chosen cities. Every major metro area should be included by this point. The influx of revenue would allow a sufficient staff for vetting. Every metro could have one staff member...and a volunteer vetting team...volunteers could be offered free memberships or gift cards. A notary or group of notaries in every large metro could be used to verify information. Applicants could also scan information and email it to the central office for additional verification. This would give applicants something to do to speed up the process....it puts the work in their hands...and they would have the motivation or drive to do it because they want in (saving $ on labor costs). The leadership of this project put too much focus on the LinkedIn/FB model and didn't have the vision to offer alternative pathways for joining. Those are 3 big failures (1. limiting cities & cherrypicking...which choked off revenue from applicants happy to pay larger than normal fees...this also choked off the dating pool early...when early on...you need a large, more active & enthusiastic pool of people. 2. Not utilizing members & applicants to do much of the work themselves and using notaries, saving on the cost of labor. A hybrid model involving consumers & a system of employees is called a sweat equity approach. I am more than willing to send in my ID and have my employment & ID, verified by a local notary and to do my own criminal record check or assist this company in the process of doing one. This is what you need for a startup such as this one- a sweat equity approach. 3. Relying too heavily -to the point of tunnel vision- on a shortsighted model involving LinkedIn & FB. When you have your business too closely reliant on other apps...you leave it vulnerable. It's survival would be dependant on those other apps. Those apps could change their privacy policies, TOS, could be sold to an unsavory entity, or could close for a number of reasons at any time without warning. The platform should have the ability to stand on its own. There are tons of other problems with the project as well. The leadership needs to pause & rethink their approach...change the structure & vetting procedures and start over with a new more comprehensive launch.  None of the waiting list nonsense. It should take no more than 30 days to get approved. If the leadership is too stubborn and refuses to change its approach...the project will fail. It likely needs new developers & new faces in their business mgt and R&D senior leadership teams.",1,4,1.13.3,2017-10-23 05:14:29,"Hi Edward, thank you for your very well thought out feedback.
