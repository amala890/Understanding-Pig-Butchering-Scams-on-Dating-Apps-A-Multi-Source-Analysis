1. Scammer Personas
2. Common Tactics by Scammers
4. Duration of Interaction
5. Countries with Most Scam Reports
6. Financial Loss Incurred
7. Dating App Analysis

After labeling the above scenarios, associated dating app names were extracted from each post (where available) to map scam reports back to specific platforms.

Posts that do not provide sufficient context or do not contain recognizable keywords related to scams, tactics, losses, or app mentions  are categorised to "Unknown".
