1. I cannot delete my profile. The instructions say that if I can‚Äôt it is because I did not verify my email. NOT TRUE! I did verify my email and my email is linked to my account. That is how the developer contacted me, via email - garbage!
2. Most of the profiles are not local women - garbage.
3. The app CONSTANTLY tries to hit you up to pay for the service. Just make a pay for use app and don‚Äôt bill it as free - garbage.
4. You can contact some local users but not others and there is no explanation why - garbage.
