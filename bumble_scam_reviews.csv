After making my profile I immediately had 8 likes went through all my swipes and the next day the likes disappeared. I've even had the paid membership with zero real interactions so from my take, don't seem too legit.

Like all dating apps, it started as actually wanting people to connect. But now, with profile bots and nothing but IG promos on BIOS that don't get filtered out. A simple Bluetooth is always on feature would help counter fake profiles from farming multiples. I keep seeing the same people I already swiped on.

It's a total money trap praying on folks who are looking for companionship. You have to pay extremely ridiculous prices for the app to function in an acceptable capacity. An example is they charge you 50$+ for 30 more ""likes."" So even to like a profile, there is a monetary factor. They tell you that if you buy a year subscription, it's under 15$/month. But if you want to try it for 1 month, it's closer to 40$/month. This app is just a racketeering scam.",2,0,5.391.0,2024-10-23 12:36:46,"Thanks for your feedback. Our core features are free.
