I’ve tried a lot of apps, and this is the only one I’ve deleted in just a few weeks. 90% of matches don’t respond when I reach out with a first message, among the 10% there were fake profiles that made me feel unsafe. I’ve had decent success on other apps with matches who were potentially the type of people I would meet. I am personable and polite with good values, look good, am well educated and have a great job. I understand that the type of matches you get has a lot to do with your photos and what else you put on your profile, and I was careful in choosing whatever has given me decent matches on other apps. I got a few good potential matches on Bumble the first few days, until I paid for a one month membership, after which I regretted being on the app. I reached out to their support team about a fake profile, and got a standard reply that they are looking into it. Several potential matches were people traveling here from a different country. The last straw was when I got a like from someone who said ‘swipe right if desperate’ and another that said ‘face it, you need a man in your life’. Well, this app really made me feel like I don’t need a man in my life if this is how the men on here are. Is forcing me to message first going to solve all these issues?

I had Bumble for about 2 years straight. One of the women I met off there ended up stalking me and I deleted the account out of fear she would create fake profiles and try to monitor me. Needless to say I ended up moving for work and decided to make another account now that I felt safe. Within the first hour I had several likes, however, that stopped instantly after that. Nothing after that first hour (I live in a large metropolitan area so this is unusual). I’m also not an ugly guy by any means. It’s not difficult to see who likes your profile since bumble’s blurred image for your queue is easily distinguishable when swiping. I noticed that one particular like I had showed up in my stack and I didn’t swipe on it initially. I reopened the app later to see my likes disappear. HOWEVER, these profiles still showed up in the stack and they are unable to unlike your profile once they’ve swiped right. This happened with almost all of the likes I had and they weren’t bot profiles. I received no more likes since that first hour and I kept the app for a week and a half to make sure.

I don’t know if it’ll work out or not why should I pay 40 dollars just to see someone’s profile that may or may not be close to me at all! It’s a joke and a scam. If you wanted to help people meet other people why make them pay for it? Why couldn’t you just put ads in from sponsors like you do for push notifications? That gives you money doesn’t it?

They said it’s cause of advanced filters, but I swiped so much when I had filters on, that it started expanding out side of my filters (mind you, I had filters even before I had premium, so nothing changed) and that still doesn’t change the fact that with every swipe I get (and I swipe right on literally everyone because I’m desperate to make friends) none of them end up being the people that matched with me.

They also have no incentive to filter out and remove fake and old profiles. The technology to do this is extremely simple, available, and inexpensive to implement. They want lots of fake profiles because they make money off of it. For example, they have a feature you can pay for called “super swipes“ where you can skip the waiting process and tell someone immediately that you are interested in them. If you send a super swipe to a fake or old profile, Bumble makes money off the super swipe, and the consumer gets nothing. This app is literally fraudulent.

So to be permanently banned for no reason and to be told I broke a community guideline without any specific reason behind it or any previous warning etc is crazy. I don’t speak rudely, don’t use vulgarity, don’t demean or insult others, and don’t even use the app. It had been 2 years of walking away from dating and focusing on myself. I get back on speak with 2 people, meet 1 of them, and that didn’t go great 😂. She believed it was okay to create a fake snap chat account and scam men of their money. I respectfully moved on and then was banned. Unsure if it’s related or not but hey I was told literally nothing as to why 🤷🏼‍♂️. I won’t use the app again or recommend to anyone. Pretty insane and this is the first permanent ban I’ve ever obtained on any app, game, or technological service including when I was 19 on Tinder, being a bad kid on Xbox Live, and well I can’t think of anything else. Anyways, just thought I should put that out there. Your best bet is to never use a dating app, go get in shape, get a good job, and then hit on women in real life 😂🤷🏼‍♂️. Shocking I know!

They offered me a “deal” to pay to unlock unlimited swipes exactly one profile before they told me “Thats’s everyone” so there are no more profiles to see! What a scam! I just upgraded to the latest version, and now it pops up an “upgrade” ad that must be dismissed every single time I come back to the app, which is sometimes every 30 seconds! I have a lot going on and can’t just sit in the app swiping forever, I have to take care of other things. They also “hide” where people are located/live at the very bottom of people’s profiles instead of at the top, which is usually the first thing I want to know. So you have to scroll down all the way to the bottom to find out if they live somewhere else, and then have to scroll all the way back up to the top if they actually are local so I can actually look at their profile. So tedious and terrible design! Also, I really hate that it seems like they’ve intentionally designed the app so it is way too easy to accidentally “swipe” to like/dislike someone, and then they disable being able to go back unless you pay!

I’m a decent looking guy with a great personality but this is my fourth time using and deleting this app. I think the quality of people on here are all a little too judgy and shallow... it seems like everyone is trying to be a model or something... fake and glamorous with ZERO conversation. I’m sure the women are bombarded by sooo many men but I’m not willing to pay after I have been burned in the past on these apps. Sure it works great and you get like 10 swipes a day... but what it really is doing is turning men and women into literal vending machines where all the adventure is tKen out of spontaneous attraction and dialed down to a measly swipe where we all live on instant gratification and people are LITERALLY shopping for a date. I fall victim of this too and it’s just toxic for the human soul to shop around everyday for a date and it never gets a real connection. I would get out and grow so confidence and try to meet people in the real world because I believe this subconscious on demand shopping for dAtes has really destroyed the male And female psyche of attraction.

You can post videos and pictures and be in no violation of their rules and they will still delete it even if you write to support they will not respond knowing they are wrong. Even if your a paid customer. Their support is horrible. I don’t recommend downloading the app I have paid numerous times inky times be disappointed with their support. It’s easy to take a persons money sad to say it’s hard for them to do their job. Till this day I have not received a refund nor have I had any luck as half the people in there are either fake or are just looking for chatting buddies.  Their timer to swipe does t even work properly and your limited in swipes. You get more results in tinder and more swipes on the tinder and their timer works Accordingly. This site has driven men away from it so if your a woman signing up. I would think twice. Best site u have found so far and does t cost anything is Facebook dating. Blows this app away.

They say the core app is “free” but they don’t put your profile out there unless your paying though. I’ve been using it for a bit now and I’ve gotten like 2  likes, and that’s not matches that’s just likes. I’m by no means a bad looking guy or boring. But in order to see likes you gotta pay, but I’ve been swiping every day till I run out of daily swipes. For the number of swipes it’s gotta be statistically impossible for there not to be a single match. Plus only the two likes in all that time? It seems like they plant profiles to like you to get you to pay to see your likes. And if you don’t pay they don’t put your profile out there for others to see which would explain why I haven’t a single match in over a year. If they lowered the prices they would get so much more business. It’s a good idea but a scam if your not into paying a ton for the possibility you maybe get a like or two…",1,False,Feeling scammed,Johnny War,True
