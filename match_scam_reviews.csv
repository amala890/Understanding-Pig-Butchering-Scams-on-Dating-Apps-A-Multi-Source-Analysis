2023-01-18 10:15:15,,"Hinge is by far the best of the big dating apps. The free features are far and away much better than the others. Accidentally swiped left? Just undo it. Hinge let‚Äôs this essential feature still be free while others charge for it. Hinge is also the most real of the big apps. I‚Äôve had more actual connections and real dates with Hinge than Tinder or Bumble‚Ä¶ COMBINED. And it‚Äôs not even close.

This would‚Äôve been a 5 star review a year ago, but a problem has surfaced that has plagued the others. One of Hinge‚Äôs best qualities has been that their process helped make sure their users are actual people. I don‚Äôt know if something changed in their verification process or a way has been found around it, but now there seems to be an alarming number of bot and fake profiles. It‚Äôs still not as bad as Tinder or Bumble, but as one of Hinge‚Äôs greatest strengths, this new problem is worrisome. Maybe what they need to do (as all dating apps should) is tie an account to a phone number, device, and GPS location (and possibly third party 2 way Authenticator). If a profile is banned because of being a bot or fake, a new one can‚Äôt be generated if it‚Äôs deemed the information has already been used. Make it more expensive and troublesome for scammers.",3,False,Fury Contained,"Still the best, but problematic lately",True

Not only do you preferences mean virtually anything (considering they show you everyone who is polar opposite of what you are looking for), it will show you 10 people and say there is no one else in your area. You‚Äôre going to tell me there is only 10 people using this app within 20+ miles? I find that extremely difficult to believe. I have deleted my account, logged out, made a new account as suggested by customer support to see if this will fix my experience... it fixed it for about 10 minutes showing me people within my preferences and then the algorithm was completely wrong once again. I even have spent money on the premium version to increase my chances- this app is pathetic and the customer support is a joke. They basically say there is nothing we can do and that the more you swipe, the better the algorithm becomes and will show you people in your preferences. How can I swipe and increase my odds when not one single person is within my preferences? I‚Äôve used this app for a year and haven‚Äôt received one like, one comment or anything and I can assure you that there is nothing wrong with myself or my profile. This is a joke and don‚Äôt spend money on this nonsense- it‚Äôs a scam and very discouraging. Hope this serves y‚Äôall some support.",1,False,mat77722,Algorithm and Preferences,True
2020-10-26 14:41:22,,"Very disappointing. I think guys on here who are wanting to sneak around behind their SO‚Äôs back flock to this app because it‚Äôs not as popular as competitors. I‚Äôve used this app of and on for a couple years. I have yet been able to talk to a guy who, upon finding their social media, had a current girlfriend or wife. Other girls have gone through similar experiences with THIS app alone. My friend actually dated someone she found from Hinge for months just to get a Facebook message from his wife of 5 years one day. Another friend dated someone for a whole year just for us to discover he too had a girlfriend of two years. In my own experience, I had a random girl send me a screenshot of MY (now ex) boyfriend‚Äôs profile through Instagram. 

I see a lot of guys on Hinge also on Tinder, their Tinder bios will say looking to hookup, but their Hinge profiles will be very bland, saying the biggest risk they ever took was *this app* üôÑ. Guys I‚Äôve found with detailed profiles always seem to be hiding something or someone. If someone is using this app to cheat, or to simply get their nut, their needs to be a report system in place so their account can be disabled.

I‚Äôm great full for that but the app has changed suddenly.  I decided to pay for the longer subscription then I have before and right away I got so many fake/scam accounts that I couldn‚Äôt believe it!  I would match with someone and start talking then they would disappear from my matches‚Ä¶ then I would get an email from hinge saying that they were fake accounts that were removed.  I have also needed to make a lot of reports for accounts I know were fake but somehow showed verified‚Ä¶

The amount of fake accounts that showed up after I paid a lot was awful.  It got so bad that I‚Äôve never seen so many fake accounts on any other app in a short amount of time and that‚Äôs saying a lot!  One of the last people I matched with ended up just being a troll account and stood me up after we set up a date.  I regret paying for this app and had much better luck with the free version at the beginning of the year and last year.

2021-06-04 17:31:26,,"My experience with Hinge was a complicated one, which has unfortunately led to huge financial loss. I‚Äôm writing this review so that people are more aware of potential romance scams that take advantage of the pandemic and emotionally vulnerable people.

I was matched with an initially very nice gentleman who has a relatively generic profile and we started talking. We got along really well and were able to carry on deep conversations so I was happy that I found someone who shared hobbies and values with me. About three weeks later he started to causally mentioned this investment he was doing and how great it was, and he offered to ‚Äúteach‚Äù me more. I initially wanted to learn about investment so I went to the website he provided, which eventually turned out to be a fraudulent platform that closely mimics the real investment company. Once you invest money it would show how much asset you have and it looked great until you realize you can no longer withdraw money and the ‚Äúcustomer services‚Äù ignored any related questions.

Hinge has real members in okay supply, okay features, and decent members.  The pre-acquisition OkCupid was the premier online dating platform, but it‚Äôs been destroyed.

The price is $50/month for premium or whatever it‚Äôs called, and $75 for 50 roses.  If you‚Äôre a highly sought after girl/guy, you might not have to spend any money ‚Äî just be willing to go through people to send likes so that you can get matches.  Likewise, you might not need the roses but they help if you‚Äôre the initiator, especially since Hinge paywalls some of the most sought-after individuals behind roses.

If you consider yourself repulsive or a prostitute, welcome to Hinge this is the place for you. But knowing this, the Hinge team has made it intentionally difficult to use the app, which induces user fatigue to make sure you can‚Äôt swipe through volume because their volume is extremely low value.

Also, so world class yet can‚Äôt have a customer support team tell you why your account was deleted.
