This platform is riddled with fake profiles and they don’t act on cleaning those even after reporting them. The only times your inbox is full is whenever your subscription expires and suddenly an army of fake profiles swarm your inbox making you believe to pay for an additional time. Every time my subscription renews there is a technical glitch and they demote my profile to a non paying member in-spite of my account getting charged. I have to connect to the super late technical staff only through emails. Until this time, they had fixed my issue. But this time they even declined to fix it as they mentioned that I bought my subscription through the App Store and not through their website. I argued I have already paid for the subscription and need my services restored. They flatly refused and asked to reach out to Apple company. I reached out to Apple to find a resolution and after two months of emails and calls they refunded but guess what. They refunded from the time when I asked for the refund while conveniently ignoring that the services haven’t been working since day one of the subscription renewal.

I didn’t use premium because it’s just not worth my money, and thus the people that are shown on my feed are either definitely not my type, way too far away (I set my distance to 25mi and I saw profiles from SEVERAL U.S. STATES OVER), or are clearly fake profiles out to steal my information. For example, I’ve matched with someone who wanted my number right away. Instant red flag. When I gave them my number anyway and we started talking, they gave me a long story about how they just got out of a toxic relationship, that they were looking to hookup, and that they’re turning 18 soon. The problem with this? Their OKcupid profile clearly stated that they were 19, looking for friends only, and mentioned that they haven’t been in a relationship for quite a while. The worst part? I’ve seen that exact copy-paste story from a different user I’ve previously matched with (and blocked). They even forgot my name. I became so frustrated that I deleted my account and removed this app from my phone. I may not have had much luck with dating apps, but I’m no longer going to waste my time using this one.

2022-07-30 01:01:35,"What this app does well is allowing you to fill out a profile on smart prompts. There are some problems with the app, but they’re not immediate. Swipe left, swipe right, give someone a super like: pretty basic stuff. But the basic paid package advertises no ads—and there are indeed less ads once you start swiping. They still advertise their premium service and their boosts, and they do it in the main screen where you swipe left and right on people. This means that you cannot mindlessly swipe endlessly—you’ll have to pause to click the x button on the screen when you accidentally swipe right on the boost or premium.

More damning are the technical issues: mysterious badges that say you have messages waiting, but when you click the button to show you those messages nothing pops up. Then the app sometimes freezes on the main screen, meaning you have to exit, close it, reopen it, and try again. This happens every fifteen to twenty minutes of rapid swiping.

I’ve enjoyed the people I’ve had conversations with on this app, and there are not too many people trying to scam you, but they are there. However, the vast majority simply don’t respond to first responses, even though both of you have to like each other for them to show up in the message feature.",2,False,Don’t pay for it,Chris And Again,,True

For two years it was fine and then all of a sudden last year my account got suspended. And so I said “screw it” and made a new account, this account got suspended too because apparently they IP ban instead of banning an individual account. So now I have permanent inaccessibility to this app. How is this app even still running? They let fake profiles on loose yet I’ve been a member for two years and I get suspended, what the hell okcupid? And it’s not just my account getting suspended, I read some threads on reddit and people were getting suspended for no reason (because okcupid doesn’t let you know what you did wrong) and it’s just so convenient for them to not have a customer phone line or an email to address issues and misunderstandings. I honestly have no clue how they are even having a business when they just permanently IP ban people for no reason. It just seems like they are just getting your info, selling it to whatever partnership they have, and banning accounts.

I recently came back and now I feel like I can breathe the questions are actually to die for the percentage of matches doubles the more questions you answer and the profiles are expansive. You actually get to know the people your looking for rather than reading a fake bio that leaves you hanging and has no frame on the basis of your personality… you don’t have to be a creative writing prodigy in order to have a good relationship with someone. It sets the bar low enough that the average person can be on the app and not be lost in complexity and high enough that it’s entertaining to be on.

However I was dead wrong. Once you pay for it all those people go away and the only people I see are passport people or international people. Interesting at first but then i expanded the age range and made all genders available within 50 miles and still the only people available are international. So it literally tricks you telling you there is tons of people around you when it’s free trying to get you to buy it, but once you do, there is nothing. I bet the international accounts are fake as well. Then if you have an iphone it says in their help text that they can not issue refunds because of something that apple prevents on their agreement.

All you get are likes from women from different countries. When I changed my preferred distance to 10 miles instead, I kept getting women who claim to be nearby, but then say in their bio that they “changed their location to meet new people.” That goes against OkCupids guidelines, and they don’t seem to care enough to do anything about it. In addition, there are more fake/bot accounts on this app then actual people! I have screenshots of at least 100 obvious fake accounts, trying to get you to add their Snapchat, for “nudes.” More recently, I came across a glitch where Okcupid would only show me men, and would only show my account to men as well.

I think they have the worst algorithm out of all the dating sites. And over half of the profiles in the bay area or fake. There are still less fake profiles then other sites but for how much it cost it’s pretty absurd. In addition the last time I paid for a premium I had eight or nine likes saved up and thought it was a good time spend a little money. Upon getting my premium subscription renewed I found out most of the lakes were overseas because of the new passport feature. I feel like people in other countries liking people that are not from the same location should not show up unless you opt in to the passport feature. I have no time to talk to somebody in another country especially considering almost all of the overseas profiles seem to be fake.

Long story short, if somebody likes you, they are immediately hidden from you permanently and you’ll only ever see them if you pay. In most apps you can pay to see who likes you, but it’s a shortcut to save time and you still might run across those people during the normal course of using the app. With this app, that’s not the case. There’s no chance, ever, that you will run across somebody who likes you without paying. 0% chance. You will see the same profiles you have said no to literally 15 or 20 times over and over again without seeing a single person who has already liked you. Those people are hidden inside a “likes” stack that you have to pay to see. Again that stack is not just a shortcut to those who like you, anybody who has ever liked you is permanently hidden there and will always be behind a wall.

The last time I bought a subscription, the people who liked my page were not in my search settings. Many of them were out of the country. In that time, I only received one or two likes. After I ended the subscription, the likes jumped back up considerably. 

Now this is where I feel OkCupid is deceptive. The total number likes never go away. After I swipe left on a potential match, I’ll get a notification saying I missed a match. But the total likes doesn't decrease. So at this moment, I still have 61 likes. This is absolutely deceptive. I can’t trust that OkCupid is actually providing and selling an honest product. And this is before mentioning the base monthly subscription starts around $35. 

So in the end, I’m being offered a dating service product that costs considerably more monthly then tinder and bumble.

OKCupid has told me that once my subscription lapses it reverts back to “total number of likes” and that these aren’t necessarily new likes.

Can’t see likes so you pay for the service only to find out they are all from overseas or “banned” accounts.

The day after your subscription expires, you log in and BOOM 50 likes.. so you think we’ll they are probably all spam again, so you broke down and paid again. Yup all spam, from Thailand or china or somewhere else across the globe, all of which have one pic and then say to reach out on Snapchat. You go through the rest of the month, and again not a single like or response. Your subscription expires again and once again, SURPRISE you again have like 30 likes.

When your a free account you get lots of spam likes so you pay for the app, then don’t get a single like while your paying.

Bottom line: this isn’t a dating app anymore, hasn’t been for a while. It’s just an ad platform designed to extract money from all who use it, not to mention the data they collect (see the Apple store list to see the whole big picture). While there’s not really a good app out there anymore the best advice I can give is STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE AT ALL COSTS.",1,False,The app is filled with nothing but scams,Xc_runner23,,True
2019-07-08 19:02:39,"I’ve used OkCupid often on several times over the years to meet new women and get out and date always hoping to find a long-term relationship. I’ve gone on my fair share dates but they’re always far apart from each other I get the perks that come with paid for a membership like seeing who likes you without actually matching, this really confuses me it says I have 65 people who like me but yet when I go through the quick search And swipe right every time that I would eventually come across who’s like give me before I like their needless to say I never hit any of the 65 suppose likes makes me feel like it’s a lie when you could swipe 200 people as like in a row and not hit one. I’ve lost hope on love thanks to these apps.

Update: I’ve noticed I Deleigh get notification saying someone likes me so I opened it up and start to swipe up and not once have I ever found this person this sounds like a Wyatt or a scam to get me to buy the VIP because I find it hard to believe a dating site is going to make a dozen possible to find your matches as possible but OK see those.",1,False,Not much improvement from the rest,Jeff-a-dub,,True
2022-04-28 15:04:00,"This app use to be ok and I use to find it to be one of the better dating apps. Not anymore! It’s just like the rest of them now. It keeps going downhill with every update. I remember when you can filter out your preferences and they’ll show you actual matches, but now the filters are useless because you get users in your feed that don’t fit your preferences. It’s almost like they want to make it impossible for you to meet someone so they can have more users and if you’re a paid account, keep paying money.  You’re not notified in the “intro” section if you get an intro. Don’t get me started on all the fake accounts and photos that don’t get removed, or people violating the community guidelines don’t get removed, or they’re allowed to continually make new accounts. The mods need to do a better job at removing photos/accounts that don’t belong. Also they need to adhere to their own community guidelines and not pick and choose based on the person in the photo.",2,False,No longer good,tm_09,,True
2023-06-13 19:53:36,"I have swiped left on several of these women several times already but OK Cupid keeps sticking them back in my Likes You queue, randomly, every couple of weeks. The other big scam with this app is when you let your subscription expire. Suddenly, even though you’ve had virtually no likes in weeks, your queue fills up with several dozen Likes in the next 48 hours. It’s a scam. Most of them are fake profiles or they are profiles from Third World countries. Even if your filter is set to within X miles. OK Cupid simply tries to profit off your curiosity by gaming the system. So despite their efforts to make it seem like they actually care about connecting people, it’s just a money grab. And a manipulative one at that.

I tried the app again about a year after I had tried it the first time, and it was even worse. I received about 200 likes in two weeks. 180 of them were women from Third World countries. Meanwhile, I started getting a ton of spam email and text. This app is a total scam. They are just using it to sell your data.",1,False,Terrible,JS6798,,True
2023-08-08 04:50:10,"They tell you if you pay for premium you will see your “likes”. That’s an outright lie. They will show you SOME—about half—at most— in “the list”. If you swipe relentlessly, though, you will find dozens and dozens more which they held back. You can swipe for days and still find the hidden ones, even after you pay. And even after they say the “stack is empty” they are still holding back dozens. They will dole them out to you slowly, as it suits them, just to keep you paying. OkCupid has NO desire for you to find a match. That would ruin their whole scam. They have a vested interest in keeping you as far away from matches as they can for as long as they can— even AFTER you pay. After all, they don’t want you to only pay THIS month. They want to get your money EVERY month. But of course the internet is like the wild Wild West. There is no real law. No one is going to investigate or prosecute them. They can do as they please. What are you going to do? Call them and file a complaint? Hahahaha 😂",1,False,The biggest scam going,verydisappointed10572,,True
2022-02-12 14:47:51,"Plenty of fake profiles but the biggest thing is how about everyone who ends up liking you with just means they sent a like, is out of the country. When I first made a profile without paying it said I have 23 likes. I figured it was fake but my curiosity got the best of me. Signed up and sure enough, mostly people from all over the world. So I had a month left. Well on the very first day that my sub ran out, I woke up in the morning to 19 more likes! Yea sure. I’m not getting fooled again. Don’t waste your time. They bait you in to take your money. Just like every other dating site. None of them are worth it. The chances of finding a partner these days is almost impossible. That’s if you have good values. If your a selfish conceded narcissist blind sheep, you might do alright. Everyone is for themselves. The traditional couple is about over. They just want sex and money. Immature narcissist. Disgusting. The mature people with good morals are out there, just hard to find. Good luck.",2,False,Not worth it.,G=bassdude,,True
2017-11-28 16:37:31,"I've done Match, Plenty of Fish, Zoosk, Our Time. This is by far the best. I love the OKC quiz that lets you learn more about a prospective' interests, background, and sensibility. It also gives you a compatibility % for each person you click on, compared with how you answered. The site also allows for the most variety of descriptions in the Profile -- you not only do a summary, but list some of fave things to do, strengths, etc. And it's all easy to use. And lots of good, quality potentials. And you get a lot of features for free -- including Sending and receiving texts. The only thing I'd recommend is for OKC to vett people like Zoosk does, with Facebook or photo confirmation of ID. Since it's free, OKC attracts a lot of scammers and fake profiles -- some with perfect grammar, so not always easy to spot. But otherwise, I recommend highly.

2023-11-20 13:50:13,"I honestly don’t know how it’s possible, but the app is getting worse every month.  The likes do not disappear if you dislike them, there is absolutely no A.I.-powered catch system to prevent fake or dishonest accounts, and their proprietary q&a system was dumbed down heavily.

I invested once in the premium package to sift through the 20+ likes I had built up, because I was getting absolutely no matches.  It turns out that the majority of them were non-US accounts, who were looking for green cards.  Ever since, I make sure to just swipe left 100 times or so on that irrelevant Passport section.  Despite doing this, and getting “missed potential match” messages, my likes never go away.  Why is this not a thing when it is on every other dating site?  I even have to stop my swipes every so often to report some of these accounts who think the only profile picture they need is of flowers or a couch.  How does OKCupid not do some housekeeping to realize that there are no humans in these photos or accounts?",1,False,An Absolute Dumpster Fire,Stevie Pepperino,,True
2022-08-16 06:09:26,"OkCupid makes it actually hard for you to find people who are interested in you without paying a large $40 monthly bill. That price hasn’t been reduced either and I just started to get ads on top of that. Not only that but if you have a preference set on distance you will still receive likes from people out side of said distance. You’ll get a lot of fake profiles from the Philippines as well. And let me assure you they have no incentive to change that. You’ll think “wow I have 20 likes, maybe paying for the monthly sub would be worth it!” Just to find out it’s all people who live in another country when you have it listed for a 30 mile range. In short OkCupid has some predatory practices and their focus on finding you a real potential partner is actually close to non existent. What they excel at is taking your dollars for a rather lack luster service. If you are looking for a dating app that makes it atleast semi easy to connect with people try Facebook dating.",1,False,Money over love! The OkCupid new slogan.,patty1337,,True
2020-07-03 13:34:35,It would be great if the percentages that you match us up we would be actually true I know sometimes it’s not as safe as it should be on an online dating site but having the ratings is pretty cool for the percentages it’s pretty cool but most of the time when you talk to these guys because I’m a girl it doesn’t matter if you are really compatible with them and then still say and do respect for stuff and if we report them they should be notified of what they did note of the person that notified you of what they did and be reprimanded for it maybe they will be true when they get on the site and not trying to hurt people I think the site is pretty good I guess you got to take care of yourself and be mindful of the guys that could be out there lurking to scam you,5,False,If it was only true about the Percentages,nudg me,,True
2024-03-29 00:38:10,"Just an absolute horrendously horrible app. I cannot express how bad this app is. I sign up and right off the bat I have 40 likes? I know they’re baiting me to pay for a subscription so I can see who liked me. I figure I’ll try it for one week, what’s the worst that could happen? It took me one minute to swipe left on all 40 likes. I would guess 90% of them were obvious fake profiles. Most of them were from Nigeria, Philippines, or some other obscure part of the world. The rest were from people not even remotely attractive or compatible with me. It’s very similar to Tinder, I can swipe on profile after profile after profile and get ZERO matches. I have basically the same profile on Hinge and FB Dating and always get matches and dates with those. If you’re reading this and debating on trying out this APP, for the love of God let me save you the trouble and some money and your time, just don’t waste your time with this garbage dating app",1,False,"Dating apps are terrible, this one takes the cake!",TACRD,,True
