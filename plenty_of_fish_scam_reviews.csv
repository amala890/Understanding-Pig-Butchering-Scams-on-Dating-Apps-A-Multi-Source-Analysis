There is an option to change your search parameters to search for either everyone, or just women, or just men. When you enter to change the search parameters and include only men, and then return to your search profiles again, both genders still show up, effectively ignoring the changes you just made to your search parameter preferences. In addition, the is also an option to change the ages for your search, as the app defaults to +10 or -10 years from your age. This feature allows you to change the slider to widen their age range, but yet again, when you attempt to search using these changes, the app doesn’t recognize the changes you made. And don’t even think about using the website to make changes with which to then search profiles, because making the same changes on the website also don’t apply.

I’m looking for women above 5’10 and it just sends whatever. The app loves randomizing what you see, like every window has a line of visible women in it. These reset on their own so if you saw on in the messages window and went to the message, any women you wanted to look at would be refreshed away.

I have reported at a minimum 20-30 profiles in which they have all been confirmed and removed.. (those are just the ones of matching with). You can tell scrolling through right off the bat they are all spam. Fake usernames ending with a long number. 1-2 pics that are grainy. Details don’t match their pics.  I have two other dating apps. Hardly ever have issues w the other apps. This one the developers just do not care. They just take your money and run knowing that the app is completely ridden with spam. All they would have to do is automatically flag profiles with certain keywords but they simply do not care. I paid i think nearly $100 for this and I’m actually going to delete it after this review.

No topless body shots either. Well that’s what you see in a lot of these, phones covering the face body shot and no shirt  
2nd I get messages from the “same” person all the time. But they magically don’t remember either. Even though they sent me a message from a different profile name not more then a minute ago. There a lot of fake people, half the profiles on this app are fake. 
3rd to much phishing, no pun intended. Most of the fake profile are sadly posing as military. 
Example: I’m over seas, and I wont be back in the US yet. But I’d like to know more about you. The question they ask could easily be used to steal your identity. But the icing on the cake, is when they ask you if you have kik or whats app, to get to know you better. Because they are to busy to keep messaging you on the app. both kik and whats app are bad apps and have been used in trafficking.

Can’t turn that part off either, the notifications are annoying. Now also seems to be lot of profiles that require you to upgrade to be able to talk to them. Not sure why but that seems like a scam to get you to upgrade. The quality of people are questionable to say the least. I’ve been contacted by prostitutes, people wanting to score drugs and people wanting money, rides or a place to live. It’s like being in a virtual trailer park at this point. Guys are at a huge disadvantage (as on most sites) because the women have a smorgasbord of men to choose from. So unless you have some killer first line then you will never stand out.

Even then you can’t tell if you really blocked them because you still see them in people who viewed/liked you, and you still have the option to “block” them on their page, instead of it saying you already have them blocked. If you go the “report” route, it doesn’t freeze your phone, but you still can’t tell if they’re really blocked because you still have the option to “block” them. 

The reason I wish I could give less than one star is because even if you block and/or report someone, they CAN STILL VIEW YOUR PROFILE. That’s the purpose of blocking them!! I had one man view my profile multiple times after I blocked and reported him. Your profile should be completely invisible to them, especially with the amount of creeps on there.

Second; force selfie verification, this has seemed to be the only indication I have found that a user’s account is legitimate.

The ability to not only be left with just swiping as a means to match with others makes PoF unique. This allows for people to match based on communication connection beyond just visual attraction.

I’ve never seen so many fake profiles before, and it’s obvious they are computer generated with similar names and intro summaries etc. anyone could pick them out. Obviously PoF doesn’t screen anyone or provide a suitable dating environment. Aside from sifting through hundreds of fake profiles, you don’t know who is real or not. I didn’t have a single message or message reply, most of the messages I sent were (unread-deleted) without anyone even viewing my profile, so I’m not sure what’s going on with that but it’s highly suspect. Also, the distance and age you place on filters is completely ignored. From my perspective I think PoF purposely adds fake profiles to boost their member numbers, and ignores filters so you gain more meetings, etc. because the number of real users is pretty low.

2018-08-23 00:50:57,The app freezes up a lot and takes a long time to load. Very annoying. No other dating app I use does that. There is also a lot of fake profiles with people trying to get you to give out your email to hook up for paid sex. It’s supposed to be an app to meet and date which a lot of people don’t use it that way. Just fake people trying to get money. You block them and report them and more pop up everyday. Then the app changes to a new look which I liked a lot and a week later it changes back to the old look when I open it up. No updates to cause this to happen. The most annoying thing is the loading. Sometimes it’s takes 3 to 5 minutes to freaking load. Other times I wait 10 to 15 minutes and end up closing the app or sometimes it says no internet connection when I do have connection. The app is stupid. I know very well others have this problem. So why hadn’t this been fixed? Sometimes the app won’t work at all and I have to delete it and redownload just to get it to load. Very annoying cause it’s everyday this happens.,1,False,Stinks,country75boy,,True
2020-04-02 06:06:34,"I’ve am on both Tinder and POF.  Tinder has the better look, is more user friendly and is more fun to use, but I believe it has many fake profiles and I only have matched a couple of times after many many swipes.  

POF on the other hand has a solid interface and is easy to use.  The difference between the two is actual reason for using the app which is to find someone to talk to, date, or whatever your looking for.  Just within my couple of days of using POF, I have matched with a few real women and have had conversations.  At first I didn't like the questionnaire POF required during the signup process, but after using the app, those questions are helpful. 

So overall, in my opinion, if you just want to swipe and swipe and look at pictures, then Tinder may be it.  If you are looking for something more serious or really just want to search around to see what’s out there, I would recommend POF.  Also, I see POF is more of a mature crowd whereas Tinder is more geared to a younger crowd.  

Final Verdict: For me I am still on both Tinder and POF, but if I was to choose I would go with POF for now.  More mature crowd.  More conversations.  The app seems like they’re really for linking people up instead of trying to have you pay for everything and still come up empty handed.

The replies to any sort of drill down question don’t even match the question. They want to get you on a cam so that they can get you over to an adult website. And this site makes it extremely difficult to get rid of them out of your profile which makes it hard to find actual real human beings. And if you try to report one you have to write a message over a certain amount of characters or it won’t take the report which is just another way to slow down reporting fake profiles.

Also, they all seem to use the same formula of (random name)_(random name)(Long string of numbers) as their profile name.

2019-05-26 17:40:40,"Here is my objective review of this dating application through using this site for a few years. 

Potentially, there is a lot of upside to this app. Real people seeking matches. So, for the most part I really like it and have met great people using it. 

The down side. There are TONS of fake profiles, and what appears to be a pornagraphic relationship between POF and other sites that are probably owned by the same parent company. I say this because women reach out with the same opening lines, or the same broken English phrases. When they look at my profile, it registers on “who viewed me”, but then those viewed profiles DISAPPEAR. That doesn’t happen with normal profiles. So clearly, it’s a behind the scenes sort of relationship with POF. 

I think it’s disgusting and ultimately shows a lack of respect for women, when a site objectifies women in this way. Plus, it reinforces in men’s experiences that a woman’s value is only for their bodies. 

I had to delete my profile and use any number of the other dating apps that appear legitimate and respectful. 

It’s a real shame, because the platform is great, and there are real people seeking meaningful relationships. 

But, POF is abusing their influence with the members and ultimately these fake profiles are trying to scam their users for something.

Some downsides, are that there are a ton of spam/catfish accounts (about 70% of accounts I’ve swiped through). Also the profile page for viewing a potential match, makes the profile pics very small and forces the user to click and swipe though to look at a profile.

Plan to continue using this app because it has potential to become like Hinge, Tinder and Bumble.
