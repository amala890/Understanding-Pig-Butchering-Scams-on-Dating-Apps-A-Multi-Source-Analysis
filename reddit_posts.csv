ScamBaiting,Dating App Scam,bi9y1o,zerors,https://www.reddit.com/r/scambaiting/comments/bi9y1o/dating_app_scam/,"So I've recently got a scammer through a dating app.

We matched and started chatting right away.
She was weirdly too invested and sweet, but nothing like the red flags to follow.

Over a few weeks we started chatting more frequently and she'd casually drop hints that she had money. Lots of it. *Red Flag 1.*

My spidey senses were tingling but instead of walking away I decided to see where this would lead.
I kept being aloof and not pursuing any topic related to money to see how far the scammer would go to try and bait me.

We'd often times chat for hours, about mundane things, life and so forth. Sometimes with voice, sometimes, we'd send photos to one another.

I admit that after 2 months I was considering the possibility of her just being someone really oblivious about the number 1 rule about finances.
(You don't talk about your personal finances, specially to strangers.)

Sometimes she'd casually venture back into talking about money, but, as I clearly did not pursue those topics any further, she'd drop it entirely. 
Interestingly enough, that never kept her from switching topics.

3 Months later...

One day she randomly mentioned bitcoin and how she was trying to learn more about it.
Me being someone who casually played a bit with it and have some miner friends, I got curious about the topic and indulged her.
She was very clueless about how bitcoin actually works, and had no idea it had to be mined. Which was quite interesting, as she was apparently genuinely unfamiliar with anything other than it's value and basic understanding of how the speculation alone was what dictated the price.

Eventually she dropped the bombshell.

She was part of an exchange and she was making bank through it because a manager in the exchange would advise her on how to make money. *CRIMSON DEATH FLAG FROM HELL*

My eyebrow went up and through the roof.
This was it ladies and gentleman. The long game came to a climax (or so I thought). She was about to strike.

I aloofly replied saying that sounded cool and I was happy it was working out for her. Doing my best to not let out any emotion whatsoever.

She then happily asked me if I wouldn't want to join her on the exchange and have her refer me to the guy who was managing her account.

A cocktail of happiness, sadness and anger is the best way to describe my emotions at the time.

I was happy the scammer finally came out with her fangs, I was sad because at the end of the day I have to admit I was enjoying chatting with her daily and angry because this girl whom I was chatting through text, audio and even video was clearly someone malicious doing it to take my money.

This was the first time I had seen such a long con game, and I have to say. I am genuinely impressed.

I recomposed myself, and with a wry smile I thanked her and mentioned I'd consider it maybe into future.
It was my turn to play the long game now.

She was cheerful about it and casually mentioned she couldn't wait to be able to chat together about bitcoin and make money together.

I had a hard time trying not to cringe at the very end of that sentence.

Another month rolls by, and we're still casually chatting about daily life. That topic had not come up in a while, and I was at this point actually hoping she'd just bare her fangs again. 

I'm a patient guy, but for the first time I felt a weird awkward and hard to explain discomfort about this all. This girl was extremely sweet and caring, and I knew deep down that was nothing but a façade. A shallow part of me actually wanted to believe her, which made me most sickened.

I kept on pushing forward, and lost track of when she first struck, but eventually she did it again.

She brought up the exchange and asked me what I thought about it.

I decided to investigate further into the matter, and casually let her tell me about it.

She introduced to this shifty guy called Makler on WeChat. *Satan's used bog roll flag*

I spoke to the guy faking interest and got an website address out of him.

I Google Searched the domain, lo' and behold: [Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/Furlo5L.png)

There were many other hits, but these alone were definitely the most interesting hits. I've read through it and my heart sank as I read tales of lonely men so desperate they fell for this surface level scam.

Curiosity got the best of me and I decided to take a look at the website. I had to see with my own eyes.

[Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/SEgKAzT.jpg)

Considering all the money they were making from these poor souls, I was floored that a website this dodgy looking was actually being successful at ripping off people like this.
This sad excuse of a website, a waste of bits if you will, did not even have an SSL certificate going for it.
The NFA certification was a clear bait and switch for anyone willing to do the most basic of researches, and simplest understanding of how a FOREX works.

Yet here we were.

Note: I gave up on pointing out red flags at this point. Every single line after the first red flag should be considered a red flag actually.

Anyways.

I was not done. I was not letting this end here.

I was going to waste more time. This person on the other end was going to waste her time. I was not going to let this end easily.

Having a hard time not letting my complete disgust show, I said I was going to consider it later, as I had more pressing matters, but we could discuss about it later.

Without a beat, and with an angelic smile she says that's totally fine and changes topic.

I mentioned I was feeling a bit sick and tired, and said I was going to rest. I ended the video call.

Had I not, I would have laid all this effort to waste. I was not doing that.
I went out for a bike ride and see if some fresh air would make the washing machine in my stomach go away.

A day went by and she messaged me ""worried"", asking if I was ok, and how was I feeling.

I came up with the ploy that I had caught a flu, and was resting. I'll spare you folks the details, but for a while I distanced myself a bit from it, without letting it show.

Eventually we went back into our daily tirade. As if nothing had happened. I have to give it to her, she was really good at coming up with topics to talk about, and to make matters worse, she was clearly smart and well read making talking about anything usually a pleasant time. (Except for every other minute where I'd remember this creature in front of me was playing with it's prey, me.)

Another month went by. We're 7 months in now.
Today she tried again, possibly running out of patience?

I decided to end the façade. I had her confirm the website, and then shown her what I had found regarding the site.

She faked being in shock, and suggested the possibility of it all being a smear campaign. I could not help but laugh.

I asked her why was she doing such a terrible thing.

She started to cry.

A tear ran down my cheek.

I realized I let this person into my life thinking nothing of it, and before I knew, I somehow deep down felt bad for this person.

7 months, where I let this person into my day to day. We'd chat about anything and everything. Almost like an actual relationship between friends.
Even tho I knew from the very beginning she meant to harm me, and that nothing of this was real, this hit me like a truck.

I disconnected. Turned off my phone, left it to charge and pulled my notebook, where I'm currently typing this.

I know how to proceed from here. This sadness will wear off. 

But what have we humans became?",

At first, these requests may seem harmless or even lucrative, promising easy money or exciting opportunities. However, as the tasks progress, individuals reach a point where they are unable to continue or complete the assigned missions. Tragically, this is the moment when scammers disappear, leaving victims with financial losses and a sense of betrayal.

My father has fallen victim to a dating scam on twitter and it's messing up my family.  I reported the account to twitter, but that just doesn't seem like enough.  Is there a federal agency or independent watchdog group that I can report this account to?  Is there anything the scam-baiting community can do to help?  

It's definitely a dating scam because she makes him send her gift cards to help her ""salon"" or whatever.  It's ridiculous.  43 years of marriage about to go in the dumper because of some pile of garbage on twitter.

I'm just finding out about this so I'm a little frantic. Thanks in advance!",

But the problem is im a busy person in real life so i cannot always send something back when she is texting and she send much lol, then after a week randomly she says to me i hate it you don't send much and your texts are short if you don't like me you can leave i say to her im a busy guy and she is going to fast for me and then she ghosted me lol.
 I think the scammer was thinking it didnt work with me and he never asked if i was interested in crypto. So yeah a win for me

The telegram guy (as always disguised as a young attractive woman) offered me the classic fake job scam. 
I've played along as long as I possibly could, but now I've reached a critical point. 
(the original conversation is in Italian, so I'll translate here)
I now need to ""withdraw"" the money ""made"" with the scammer's tasks using my bank account (which I obviously won't give), so I told the scammer that my account is currently frozen and asked if he was willing to pay me directly in crypto just for this time. 
The scammer then said to me that he can wait untill my bank account stops being frozen to help me withdraw. 


Now here's my question, I want to keep wasting this scammer's time as long as possible before blocking and reporting them, is there any possible way I can ""fake"" a bank account to give them. 
(I've never given this guy any real info about me except my real name paired with a fake surname, I couldn't fake my name as it is the Username on telegram, even to his scummy website I registered with a throwaway phone number and email)

Your typical fatten-and-slaughter or relationship scheme, I think, but this one keeps asking when we can meet in person? We didn’t even start our fake relationship yet haha. She also hasn’t given the scam crypto link yet. 

At first I thought it was a way to get a hold of my home address, but I when I told her I’m constantly traveling (a lie), she asked if I’ll ever visit her city. I assumed she meant hypothetically, maybe a way to gain trust, but she started asking for details on actual dates I can call off of work. My persona is a middle aged man, by the way, so I don’t even know why she’d want to meet him. 

tl;dr, My relationship scammer keeps asking to meet in person, definitely abnormal from my past experiences. What does she have to gain from that?",

ScamBaiting,Scam seemed way too legit,11128l9,Original_AiNE,https://www.reddit.com/r/scambaiting/comments/11128l9/scam_seemed_way_too_legit/,"First time posting - also on mobile sorry if formatting is weird. 

Last night someone posted an ad on a local Facebook notice board. There is a serious housing crisis where I live and it seemed like a pretty sweet deal. 3 beds, 2 bath, large open kitchen all with a fully fenced yard and pet friendly. $50 below average rent in the area, long term rental.

I messaged them because I’m not loving my landlord at the moment, but picked up pretty quickly that it was a scam. They sent me photos of a house that was very clearly new, and was also a completely different shape to the actual house. It took me a bit to get the address. I asked to see it and I was told that they would be able to get to town in the evening, but that a lot of people were interested and the house would go to the first person to put a $500 deposit down on the house. I’m not going to lie, at this point I was still really questioning whether it was a scam…

Until I realised that they didn’t ask about my employment/rental history, they ignored any questions about the house regarding internet access and phone reception. Any time I asked for specific information they blocked it and pushed for a deposit. So I said I wouldn’t put $500 down, but I’d put down $300 and asked for payment details. After I got that, I blocked and reported the account as well as reporting to local marketplace type pages. 

Another person had made a comment on the original post and i told him it was a scam, not to give them a deposit. He was very grateful, and ended up driving to the house to make sure that it was a scam. The owner, who was at home, was upset, confirmed it wasn’t for rent then contacted the police. I also contacted the police to report the “bank account” details in hopes that it will come back to something. 

The reason I’m posting this, is that they sent me bank account details for the transaction, I had assumed it was going to be a PayPal business account scam, so that surprised me. I have a name for the account, BSB and account number. But the bank is the “Hay Bank” which appears to be a phone app that lets you accept payments into your account on their app and then move the money on from there. I’m going to download the app and have a proper look, but from what I’ve seen this may make it easier for cash to leave the country.

1. They'll chat you in Viber/Whatsapp/telegram and introduce themselves as ""HR"" or looking for people to like the YouTube page, shoppee page and stuffs. 

2. They'll send a link of the pages that they're asking for you to like.

3. Once you're done liking it, they'll ask for screenshot and will tell you ""Ok, we're going to pay 150 pesos"" and then later on they'll ask for your telegram number and other personal details like age, profession and etc.


That's where our conversation ended because I blocked them and it's sounds really suspicious. Can you guys tell me if it's a scam so that other people will be aware with this kind of tactics? Thank you!",

They seem apprehensive to send money through CashApp and other apps like it and are asking me if I can set up an account at a local bank so they can send me money. I told them I don’t have a local/physical bank, which isn’t a lie, I use an online bank. They haven’t responded or looked at my most recent message basically saying no I won’t set up a bank account

I like kitbogas style because his videos are long and creative, scammer paybacksaveds victims and deleteds files and learned Hindi which is cool, Jim Browning is my favorite because he also saves victims and remains insanely calm and calculated and his evidence pksgs are outstanding.

She's devastated, embarrassed, angry, all the things. While the loss of money is hard to stomach, it's most upsetting to see how violated she feels & how she is beating herself up for this because she doesn't understand how she could be ""so dumb!""

Started with an obnoxious pop up on iPad as she was searching for a recipe in the Safari app. I'm sure you are all familiar with the one - it's flashing & beeping & says you must call Apple Security right away.  
Well, she did and that led ""David Thomas from Apple Security"" feeding her a bunch of b-s and instructing her to download the Iperius Remote Desktop app on her iPad & iPhone, then eventually on her HP. David explained that he was just trying to help her since they had identified hackers & they were working with Bank of America Fraud team to catch them. 

At some point, David ""transfers"" her to ""Jason Shore from Bank of America Fraud Team."" Jason tells her that he has personally vetted David from Apple Security some she can totally trust him that he is fine. Jason also tells her there's a pending wire transfer for over $10k (not putting the exact number here) coming out of her BofA checking account. He says the wire transfer will soon be approved & they are working with David to identify these hackers and a ""mole"" within BofA. The only way to do this is for her to initiate another wire transfer for the same amount out of the same account, and that will stop BOTH transfers because it will be a red flag for BofA. He also tells her that the ""mole"" from BofA will call her, and ask a bunch of questions, and he tells her exactly how to answer the questions. They walk her through how to do the transfer (at this point, I think it's David on the phone b/c he can actually see her computer screen). The ""mole"", Monica, calls, and says she's from BofA, recording the call, etc. then asks all the questions Jason said she would, mom answers how Jason told her to, then ""Monica"" approves the transfer.

Fast forward, I walk in to find ""David"" on my mom's computer, manipulating her screen, and ""Jason"" on the phone, letting her know that someone will ""hand-deliver"" the fraud paperwork to her in just a few days. (FYI - BofA does not have branches in our state).

We've called BofA, filed a claim, froze her credit, changed passwords, deleted that Iperius app, reset her iPad & iPhone, and will be wiping her computer. She is devastated & said she's never answering her phone again (from unknown numbers) and doesn't even want her iPad anymore.

Oh and David had the gaul to call her again this AM to ask for feedback. I was here so I answered & told him we were calling the police & reporting him to the FBI....he acted like he did nothing wrong & could still help her.

PLEASE help us get revenge or share any info you may have on these a-holes!! Will post details below.",

I am signed a camera for 1200 bucks and this guy from ""Chicago"" wants to buy his friend a camera that lives in New York. His friend has a gibberish name 

He didn't haggle or inquire too much, he asked if its works. He just said he would pay full price and even $150 for shipping. Very fishy in my opinion.

But the caveat is that he said he'll give me the $1,350 all up front via cash app or venmo. I don't understand how someone would trust anyone with that kind of situation. I'm curious how is he trying to screw me over. 

He does not want to go through OfferUp which has somewhat of a guarantee of insurance with shipping stuff, hopefully.

I'm guessing he would just cancel the payment or say that I cheated him or something like that. 

I do need the cash ASAP for something so it is a bit tempting but I know it's a trap and I don't plan to get screwed over. 

Part of me wants to just mail him a potato if it is a scam.

He will talk about partial payment that you need to do in order to get the refund as well which is another scam. He knows he scammed you once, he can milk you more.

What sort of evidence can I provide of what I find besides simple screenshots for example?

Some facts first:

* they started this around a year ago. 
* They haven't minted or released their coin yet (already passed their supposed ""launch"" date laughably) but are planning to at some point in the future.
* I haven't gone properly into their social stats yet but two of their main Twitter account have more or less 10k followers each. And several thousand accounts that they're following.
* Their ""ambassadors"" that you can find the links to on their main site either spoke about both ""projects"" little, not at all, or their accounts don't exist anymore.
* By pure coincidence it just so happens that most of their mods joined the server on that same day. Then somehow by coincidence when some person from the mod team logs off another logs in, both from their mobiles. It's so sad because I wanted to try and speak to both of them but whenever I try the other person is suddenly gone! And then he goes and the other mod comes back almost immediately. How unlucky can I be?
* They try to create popularity and visibility for their discord by using bots and very common Discord scam methods. 
* They collect people's ETH wallet addresses (no idea why) 

Its very difficult to figure out what they're promising to offer in the future, their so-called utility section is mainly filled with just typical crypto scam word vomit. Some things that I can actually name are

*  ""social network with a robust rewards system""
*  direct product and releases to shape their ""ecosystem"" (I'm dying)
*  Some kind of a metaverse? Maybe? I can't say for sure without releasing details that will identify them. 
* above ""metaverse"" will be available only to the brave ""NFT HODLERS""
* the ability to save hundreds and even thousands with discounts. No idea on what or with what.
* full launch event in a tropical paradise with ""celebrity ambassadors and advisors""


I would **really** love to share more because some of this is ungodly hilarious, and some of it disturbingly pathetic but I don't want to clue that group in about this and let them purge evidence. Even some of I already said might be too much. If anyone would like details I'd have to verify that you are not connected to the scam first.",
ScamBaiting,Seeking assistance for scambaiting - Need alternative to TextNow and Google Voice,1491tl8,Salt_Fortune_4861,https://www.reddit.com/r/scambaiting/comments/1491tl8/seeking_assistance_for_scambaiting_need/,"Hey fellow scambaiters!

I'm in need of some assistance. I'm currently trying to register for a Google Voice account, but being located outside the US, all the websites I've come across provide numbers that have already been claimed by others. Do any of you have any suggestions on where I can find a legitimate US number to use for registering on Google Voice?

Alternatively, I'd greatly appreciate recommendations for other apps, apart from TextNow and Google Voice, that I could utilize for scambaiting. Unfortunately, TextNow is not an option for me anymore. I'm unable to log in or create new accounts due to an issue where the confirmation emails never arrive. When attempting to create new accounts, I get stuck in a loop of human verifications. Despite completing ten verifications in a row, it keeps asking for one more and eventually displays an error message.

To sum up, I'm looking for a free service, aside from TextNow and Google Voice, that allows me to engage in scambaiting. I don't intend to make any money or monetize this hobby through platforms like YouTube. It's simply something I enjoy doing to assist scam victims. Thank you for taking the time to read this rather lengthy post, and I appreciate any solutions you can provide!

Cheers in advance for your help!",

ScamBaiting,Some fun I’ve had with scammers,vfuw2n,minapaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/scambaiting/comments/vfuw2n/some_fun_ive_had_with_scammers/,I just found this sub and thought my story fit here. The old IRS scam call where they tell you you can pay back taxes of go to jail. I had so much fun with these calls that I actually miss them. They wanted me to pay them with google play cards and to stay on the line with them while I went to the bank to withdraw the money and then buy the cards. I looked up what the numbers on google play cards consisted of and just gave them a random mixture. When the cards I gave them didn’t work and they asked me to repeat them I would change b’s to d’s and m’s to n’s. That call lasted an hour and at the end they told me to stick the cards up my ass. Another time I told them I would go to court and fight the charges. They asked me if I really wanted to go to “the prison”. I asked if it had air conditioning. On a different call they told me they had found a car rented by me with cocaine in it. I told them it was impossible because I fucking love cocaine and I would never let it go anywhere but up my nose. He called me as crackhead and hung up. Now I get calls about a $900 iPhone ordered on my Amazon account. I slow the call down by saying I want to right everything down. They want me to down load remote access apps and give them the access code. They claim it is a cancellation code. I’m glad to hear I’m not the only screwing with these people. Keep up the good work everyone. Hopefully the time they were occupied with us saved someone else from getting scammed.,

I saw a woman post on Facebook and add for a stay at home job. I messaged her and got the information for the Hr Manager that was doing interviews. I was told to download a messaging app to communicate with them. The company is called Luxoft. 

We were messaging back and forth about the job description, what I would be doing, Hours and pay. Everything seemed fine and legit, even the website was pretty legit. They also have a Facebook and YouTube Channel. He said they would be giving me funds to purchase the equipment I would need. A computer, printer, etc. 

He said they needed my bank login to be able to make use I was using the funds for work, which I wasn’t comfortable with someone being able to track my account. We came to an agreement that they would email me a check, I would deposit it, then I would be able to purchase the equipment through a website. 

So I did that. They sent me $200. Once i deposit it, he then says that I would have to through bitcoin to purchase the equipment and says the company has an account with crypto currency. Then started to sketch me out a bit. I’ve heard of people being scammed with bitcoin and crypto currency. 

I told him I wasn’t comfortable and he should have mentioned this before hand, and said it’s the company policy. Then told me if I don’t want to do that I can buy an Apple Card and use that but to make sure I take a picture of the receipt. I’m sitting here feeling abit uneasy now. I was going to wait and go to my bank to see what they think and to look at the check and if it’s a scam they can take the money out of back again. But I did want some advice! 

Please help! Thank you!",

I answered the call, and the guy identified himself as being part of the UK Government, and that I had to confirm my UK Debit card information for my security. He needed the card information because he works for the government and they need to protect me against scams. (hahaha).

I went online and found a fake credit card generator. At first, he asked for the 16 digits. I reluctantly gave him that. Then, he tried to ask if my card was expired (I know he really wanted the expiry date), so I gave that too. Then, he insisted that i gave him the CVC. I held him for about 10 minutes, saying that i was afraid of scams, and he kept trying to convince me that he was protecting me from scamers and that I would receive a message from my Bank confirming that the card was secure, as soon as i gave him the numbers. I started to tell him a fake story, about how in the past I fell for a computer scam, and my wife got really mad at me and left me. At first he pretended to be interested, but as the story kept going, he started to push for the CVC numbers. I told him i needed to ask my wife permission to give him the number, and that i would ask her. So, i put him on mute and left him on the desk. After a couple minutes, he hung up and I blocked the number.

I have been trying to warn her about him scamming and asking if he has asked for money (he has) and I've told her to stop texting him because he's a scammer.

ScamBaiting,I miss my scammer already.. 😭💔,op4fqi,Autopilot_Psychonaut,https://www.reddit.com/r/scambaiting/comments/op4fqi/i_miss_my_scammer_already/,"I'm going to assume this is your regular romance scam because I've noticed the pattern.. but this is the first one I went long with.

On WhatsApp, I occasionally get an international wrong number from very pretty Asian girls. I assumed this was part of a scam, so responded with the usual things you say to scammers online. They just went away. I became overly curious in the nature of the scam.

I decided that if they're using pretty young Asian girl profile pics for bait, they might be fishing for thirsty dudes to entrap them in something and get their money. This worked and took me on a rollercoaster ride.

I kinda felt bad the way an actor would, and confessed to lying to her with a third of me being sincere to this actual 31 year old beautician from Chengdu, a third knowing it's an obvious scam, and the other third curious if it's a blend of the two and that's how it works for this 31 year old pretty, Chinese scammer. 

I'm going to post it all here.. bear with me.

First off, I'm trying to be the thirsty guy commenting that she's cute: 

[https://i.imgur.com/1MwR2wM.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/1MwR2wM.jpg)

Next, some flattery and bullshittery. Already, she is fond of me because my profile pic gives her twitterpations or something:

Sure, why not:

But I'm kinda dumb:

And my girlfriend wouldn't like that:

But now a pic of seagulls and swans and an uncertain body of water:

Please verify you are a pretty young Chinese woman and not a scammer, thirsty dude style:

Still 99.99% sure she's a scammer:

Seriously, though, imma need another pic:

And she sends a pic! 

[https://i.imgur.com/T0RUgoq.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/T0RUgoq.jpg)

It matches the profile pic well enough: 

[https://i.imgur.com/p3cpzQ2.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/p3cpzQ2.jpg)

But looked painted zoomed in: 

[https://i.imgur.com/YFqRSAy.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/YFqRSAy.jpg)

This can be done with technology available to just about anyone: https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-49151042, 

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-56447357. 

Now I just want to step it up a level in confessing that I thought she was a scammer, knowing full well she's a scammer: 

[https://i.imgur.com/QtuQMYf.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/QtuQMYf.jpg)

And now it gets weird for me.. I should mention all of this occured while I was quite stoned.. anyways, as I wrote to her, the strong feeling came over me that this was not actually a scammer..

Him that i just don't have that much but he again threatened me again to file a case against me after all this i was really scared and i succumbed to his lies and even paid him 6k ruppes but when he asked for more i told him that I didn't have anymore and will ask my brother my cousin after I called him and explained the situation he said that this didn't felt right and after he called him they got into an argument the guy rven threatened my brother so my brother straight up told him that we were going to the police to file an fir and file a case against him and even report him to the cyber crime unit after which im pretty sure he got scared and even cut the call after this even after repeated calls and text this guy would not pick up .

ScamBaiting,Apple Confusion with a Whatsapp scammer.,14v4c2c,whatsamattau4,https://www.reddit.com/r/scambaiting/comments/14v4c2c/apple_confusion_with_a_whatsapp_scammer/,"I've been having quite a bit of entertainment from various scammers on Whatsapp.  I'm sure we've all received the Whatsapp message from a scammer, where they simply say Hello, and then wait for you to respond.  I usually immediately block them and report them as spam.  In fact, I still do that on my main Whatsapp account that I actually use for friends and family and business.  I don't want it cluttered with spam and scams.  But I have a backup phone that I only use as a backup, and it has a different cell phone number that I never use for anything.  So, I decided to download Whatsapp to it and see what would happen if I started responding to the scammers and playing along with them.  I am well aware that these are scammers and that they want nothing more than to steal money from me, so I had no intention of ever giving them any real information about me.  I used a fake name and fake everything about me.  The only info they could actually get about me that is real is the backup phone number, which I don't care about.  

Anyways, so what I found out is that some of the scammers are rather unintelligent and I could string them along for weeks and do all sorts of goofy things with them and they would keep on responding to me.  Some even had video calls with me and let me see who they really were.  The ones who were pretending to be women, were in fact, not women.  They were mostly young adult men in various parts of Africa. Some appeared to be of some sort of Middle Eastern descent. 

I wore dark sunglasses and one of those cheap black covid surgical masks over my face so they would not get a good photo of me to use later.  But this way I could talk to them and see where they lived and how they lived and it was quite interesting.  Many of them were living in what we would consider a shack or a very run down tiny home.  These are often very poor people, but they do have a modern smart phone and a data plan.  

And some of the scammers were quite intelligent and figured me out very quickly and blocked me from contacting them any further.  These would not do any video calling with me.  Most of them would not even do a voice call with me.  They asked for my photo, and since I used a fake photo of me and cropped out certain things, they immediately figured out that it was fake and told me so, and then blocked me.  They were not going to waste their time with me.  I figured out that I had to use a real photo of me, but I put on sunglasses and the surgical mask and I held up a piece of paper with their supposed name on it, saying ""Hi ... their name..."" and that seemed to work for most of these intelligent ones for awhile.  I don't want them using a full picture of my face for scamming purposes later on, so I refused to show them my entire face.  They could use it to impersonate me as a 30 something year old guy, and I didn't want to contribute to them being able to do such a thing.

I tested their knowledge of emo bands from the 2000s and not surprisingly, none of them had a clue about any of them, but they all told me how much they loved their songs.  I still have posters of them up of them in one of my rooms and they noticed the posters.  And that's another thing... if you do any video calling with them, be careful what is in the room with you.  They can see it and take screenshots of it and if you don't want that, then don't have any of it in the room with you where they can see it.

Most of them still wanted gift cards.  I got the idea from Kitboga to act like I was confused and did not seem to know the difference between an Apple gift card and an Applebee's gift card.   They both have apples on the cards.  I went round and round with them on this and it was quite entertaining.  And that brings up another point... they seem to like it when they think you are somehow stupid or unintelligent.  They want to feel superior and they want to be able to trick you and manipulate you.  

Another thing I learned from Kitboga was to use a claw hammer to scratch off the back of the gift card and destroy it in the process.  I took videos of me using a claw hammer to scratch off the card and then showed them the ruined card.  They got quite worked up about that and I had a good laugh about it each time.

The amount of fake romantic sentiment they showed to me was stomach turning at certain points.  They used all these over the top lovey phrases to me that I knew were so fake.  They wanted to steal money from me.  They did not even like me at all.  At one point I wanted to put their love to the test and made up a story about me being in a car accident and being terribly hurt and in quite a bit of pain.  Other than a brief sentence dealing with that, they immediately turned their focus back onto getting that gift card information.  

At a certain point when I had exhausted the fun run around with fake gift cards, they moved on to wanting PayPal and CashApp payments, and Zelle.  This is where it got interesting.  The scammers all had African phone numbers, with the exception of one from the U.K., and one from Yemen.  But, the email address for their PayPal accounts usually had a Chinese address.  Same for the CashApp accounts, they were Chinese.  They called these account holders their ""Commanders"" which I thought was rather odd. And one said they were rather ""scary.""  So, in essence, these people on the lower rungs were not Chinese, but the money was ultimately going back to China.  At least for the Whatsapp scammers I encountered.  

This is very different from scammers who actually make a voice phone call directly to my cell phone number, often from a spoofed American phone number.  All of those calls seem to be from India or nearby India.  To be honest, I can't tell the difference in accents between Indians and their nearby neighbors.  

The video calls were the most interesting part of it, and I rather enjoyed getting to see who I was dealing with and what their living circumstances were like.  I will keep doing those with anyone who messages me on Whatsapp.  The rest of it was a bit too time consuming to continue doing.  ",

ScamBaiting,A next step for email scambaiting?,kalw22,AdmiralMuffincrust,https://www.reddit.com/r/scambaiting/comments/kalw22/a_next_step_for_email_scambaiting/,"For a little while, I've started a practice that, when asked for contact details or payment, I make my first attempt to do so through an unusable attachment. What I'd do is write out a text file, then save it with a different file type, for example something like .bean or .fish. I then make up a plausible sounding app name and send it their way. 

I'd been thinking about this, and realized that maybe they'd like an online service that lets them open these files. Maybe a little website that's totally not going to take them for a ride of extra unnecessary and time consuming steps, and maybe even give them the opportunity to log in using their google or microsoft account, which totally won't harvest their credentials so that I can lock them out of the account and contact the people they'd been corresponding with to warn them about being scammed.

This is still an early idea, so still thinking about the details of some of it, but the initial idea's got me really excited.

I am undecided about the bit about credential harvesting, in case that will harm my reputation in Google's algorithm, and pre-warn the scammers.

Edit: I'm going to post ideas I get below as the start of a new comment thread. Please feel free to do the same.",

ScamBaiting,Fake PayPal ... Full Story,yroq3m,save_the_platypi,https://www.reddit.com/r/scambaiting/comments/yroq3m/fake_paypal_full_story/,"I tried to post this in my comments to my original post (https://redd.it/yqswpk), but it will not post. Reposting as a story. 
Note: Will clean out phone numbers and emails as they are no longer valid, and remove curses.

I was at doctor Tuesday (strep throat or sinus infection) and got the email. Seeing I had 48 hours to ""fix"" the issue, I waited 2 hours to get home to begin ""resolution"" to get refunded the $479.

Called the toll free number sent to me. They first asked me to go through some steps to make sure I could access my PayPal account. I was then forwarded to a 2nd representative (""security specialist""). They asked me to open my phone and install a screensharing platform (ZoHo). I installed (making sure I was very careful and remembering what I shared) and began working with them. (All my passwords are saved in a password manager so they could not see it.) I opened PayPal, showed the ""tech support"" my screen where the pending transaction had occurred. They ask me to purchase a gift card (through PayPal gifts) to make sure the connection to the bank account works ensuring me I will be refunded. (Knowing I had to buy something from that vendor, I purchased.) The representative proceeded to ask me to log into my bank account. Then had me open Zelle. As we went through the steps, they asked me to send $500 dollars to an account under a person named ""Kathy"" (California phone number, will come up later for reference). I went through all the steps and then stopped right before clicking ""complete"". Told them that I cannot do that. They then asked me to open CashApp. I opened CashApp but then they immediately hung up. Few hours later, they call me back while I was out shopping. I told them I would call them back later ... never did.

Wednesday, they call me during lunch. I start to mess with them. They ask me to install the screensharing application ZoHo. I then tell them my trial period ran out and I cannot use the application anymore. They ask me to find the email that the original invoice came to and email them (to a gmail account) ... I recited back the email transposing numbers, letters, and changing the domain; happened about 10 times until they hung up.

I called back the number, and outlined the issue of the faulty $479. They ask me to install the application ""AnyDesk"", I tell them I cannot find the application on the AppStore. They start screaming at me and then transfer me. New ""representative"" asks me to search ""TeamViewer"". I open the Wikipedia page for ""TeamViewer."" ""Representative"" asks me to read the page top to bottom; I proceed to read the entire article with minimal pauses (all while the representative is trying to interrupt me). Finally, the ""representative"" finds me getting a slight break for a breath and asks me to read out the subjects or anything highlighted in blue. I read out the table contents on the Wikipedia page. He asks me then to go to TeamViewer dot com and read the page; it was a cookies acceptance page which I read the entire paragraph. He hangs up. While I was on that thread, I missed a call which was the same number from the Zelle scam the day before.

I call back the missed number which so happens to be the same ""company"". New technician answers. I ask him his name (its Mark ... which was clearly a lie), how he is doing and for a promise he will not hang up on me, which he promises. He asks me to confirm if I can access PayPal. He then forwards me to a new ""representative"" (named ""Shawn"" ... clearly this was the same guy). I ask ""Shawn"" to promise me he will not hang up on me, which he ignores and moves to ""help"" me. Asks me to validate some credentials and to try to get into a screen-sharing. I tell them I cannot do that and they then forward me to their ""technical support"". They ask me for my email account to send me the link for the screen-sharing application; I tell them techsupport at paypal dot com. Their response was ""F*** YOU"" loud and three times. I start laughing. They ask me to hang-up and I refused. I hear them cursing at me in Hindi (bin-choad, mader-choad), so I curse back at them in Hindi. They start demanding I hang up.

I then merge in 3-way calls to the original toll-free number to get ahold of someone again without losing their connections. I finally get ahold of someone and tell them I know they are a scammer and I will continue to waste their time. They get very mad at me and tell me that they have to do it to get the $5000/month to live. We have a little bit of back and forth of them cursing at me in Hindi and English. At that point, they were so frustrated with me that they offer to pay me to leave them alone. I refused as I said that would be extortion and illegal. Their response was the kicker ... they tell me there is nothing illegal in this world; we have to take charge of our planet. (I was shocked by that arrogance.)

I told them to have a good day, but I will be posting online for everyone to call them and annoy them. I hear them screaming as I am hanging up ""PLEASE NO!""

I called back a few hours later. The representative played along with me as a confused person. Eventually they realized who it was and said ""I F***ED your mother"" and hung up.

I called back again on Thursday. All lines have been disconnected. (I also tried on another line that I have not used before and it did not get through.)",
ScamBaiting,The I’m going to be imprisoned scam,t6a92f,Tnwhitewitch,https://www.reddit.com/r/scambaiting/comments/t6a92f/the_im_going_to_be_imprisoned_scam/,"Repost from r/scams and r/scambait


So, the third scammer finally showed his hand and I’ve shut him down and blocked him. I feel confident enough to write about him. Let’s call him “Sam”.

I matched with Sam on Tinder. He supposedly lived in my area, owned his own home, and was a successful businessman. The first red flag was almost immediate, there wasn’t a profile picture. I called hm on the lack of a profile pic and he claimed that it was because he didn’t want his coworkers to know he was on a dating website. (Yea, sure that’s the reason smh) Anywho, I decided to jump down that rabbit hole just to see how far it went. This time, I took a page out of the other scammers handbook, and became the aggressor. I was the first to say “I love you” and “I want this to be forever” and “I want to marry you”.  He video called me and the second red flag appeared, he never showed himself speaking. He showed video of his dog and video of himself but never speaking and then the video abruptly ended.  We continued texting for another two days and he wanted to video call again.  (Red flag number 3) This time he was “driving” and showed me a video of Venice Beach, CA with folks in bikinis and swim trunks. Plus at the very end, the video started to loop back to the beginning. Now, dear redditors, I am hell and gone from California. In fact, I’m on the opposite side of the country. The closest beach, to where I live, is a 6 to 8 hour drive. I called him on it. He tried to tell me that he took that while driving through Nashville. I asked him when he took the video his answer was a couple weeks ago. Now folks, anyone who lives in Tennessee will tell you that February is definitely not swimsuit wearing time. In fact February and March is usually colder than your mother-in-law’s love. 

Now I’m only halfway down the rabbit hole and he’s told so many lies he can’t keep up with them. I’m a bored, petty, bitch so I would circle back to one of the lies just to catch him at it again. Plus I was really interest in what his end games would be. 

He pushed for us to meet in person. Now this threw me for a half a second, why would a scammer push for a in person date. Then he says, “What’s your address and I’ll come to your place and pick you up.” That goes past No and hell no on to  hell the mf no. He is not getting my address.  So I say, “Let’s actually meet somewhere else. I mean it would just be awkward if you came to my home and we find out we don’t really like each other”.  So I suggest we meet at a restaurant near where I live. He reluctantly agrees and we set the date and time of our meet up.

Now, I must be psychic because on the day of my “date” I texted a close friend saying, “I bet $100 he don’t show up.” I really wish sh he had taken that bet because I’d be $100 richer today. Thirty minutes before the date Sam texted me and sent me a pic of him all dressed up (to go to a fast food restaurant). Five minutes before the date, he texted again. This time he said, “my car won’t start, I don’t know what wrong with it”. 

His end game revealed itself three nights ago when he sent me screen shots of a “business contract” and “flight reservations” for a trip to Turkey. So I wish him safe travel and he leaves yesterday. Now his flight was scheduled to depart at 7 am, so color me shocked when I get a call at 7:42 pm saying that he’s in Turkey. (Red flag 4?) What he sent me stated that he was flying from our home area to Charlotte (2 hour layover) to New York (6 hour layover) to London (2 hour layover) then to Turkey. His flight from New York to London wasn’t supposed to take off till 7 pm so at 7:42 he should have been somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean enjoying his inflight meal of Turkey not touching down in Turkey. Of course, me being me, I sent him the information he sent me with a single question, “how?” He then sent me “new” flight plan that said he left from Nashville to Toronto to Turkey (13.5 hour duration with layover) and said he had a layover in Heathrow. Not possible since the new flight plan didn’t even have London listed. 

I like to think that this is where he finally found out that I’m not stupid. He sent me a text saying that his phone carrier sad he needed a prepaid card to use in Turkey and wanted me to get him a $200 Google Play card. (Same con that Cain used on me) to which I sent him the same message I sent to Cain, Google Play cards, if purchased in the US are only good in the US. Then he switched cons stating that the IRS had free zen his accounts and that he was going to go to jail if I didn’t agree to have money sent to me and me forward it to him. (My thought was ‘enjoy jail jackass’) He also included a poorly written letter from a bank with so many flaws I lost count among which were grammatical errors, a business name that wasn’t real and a business location that was actually a high rise condominium. 🤦‍♀️

Now this probably wasn’t the end of the cons he would try on me but I was bored and tired of playing with him so I sent him one last text calling him out on everything and blocked him from contacting me again. 

For those who are curious, I used Google and BeenVerified to fact check everything Isaac, Cain, and Sam said and did. Always research anyone you know honk might be a conman or scammer. 

TL;DR I got the two for one scammer this time",
ScamBaiting,Charlotte Hoppner the Romance Scammer from Hinge!,9mx7hj,traaxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/scambaiting/comments/9mx7hj/charlotte_hoppner_the_romance_scammer_from_hinge/,"So i've been talking to this girl for well over a month now by email, she liked one of my photos on the dating app Hinge..and when i looked at her photos the sceptic in me thought straight away ""No way what's she doing liking my photos..she's stunning..and i'm an overweight nerd"" lol but anyway she seemed cool..was into similar creative stuff as me..I'm a wannabe screenwriter and she wanted to be an author, she tells me she's in New York for 3 weeks doing a book course run by J.K. Rowlings.

With each email she got a little more full on, eventually telling me she was falling for me, I would love to post some of the stuff she said at some point..i actually found it hilarious!

19 year old me probably would have fallen for her tricks but 39 year old me is wise with the internet and knowing that having actual feelings for a girl ain't happening until after I've met her, however I wanted to believe maybe she was real as i wanted an escape from the dramas of my current life, but something always seemed off about her, little things like saying ""I look forward to reading from you"" instead of ""I look forward to hearing from you"" and she had no personality in her emails..she always seemed too formal like she was talking to a client.

So it's time for her to fly home, she books her flight back to Brisbane and emails me the itinerary via the booking website, when she gets back she'll fly to Sydney and we'll go on a date! I email her before she's about to fly back to wish her a safe flight and she replies to tell me the DEA has busted her with an illegal diet pill that contains Clenbuterol and she can’t leave the county until she pays a fine of $5,000! Soon as i read that i'm like ""Oh boom she's a romance scammer..now it all makes sense!""

So I reply with:

Hey Charlotte,

That's really unfortunate, obviously I'm doing quite a bit better than what you would be..

Usually they say when travelling you should have a bit of money behind you for backup in case of emergency including a credit card that you can use should such an emergency arise. Like i couldn't go travelling at the moment cause I've got quite a bit of credit card debt I'm trying to pay off and would have no way of overcoming such an emergency.

Hopefully one of your friends gets back to you! Did you try your friend Jenny who you met?

Anyway I'm quite busy at work so i should get back too it, hopefully you can sort it out soon!

===================================================================================

She replies with:

Haven't been lucky yet coming up with money, my friend told me she don't have any to spare until she gets paid at the end of the month and she can't take a loan anymore because she hasn't paid the one she took. I'm just looking for someone to loan me the money and I'll pay back when I return and back to work. Jenny as well don't have it either and she has traveled back home after the programs. I don't qualify to take a loan here or else I would have tried, I'm not a citizen here and I don't work here. Everything just seems to be falling apart right now and I'm so pissed and upset...

===================================================================================

My reply:

Hey Charlotte,

Sorry in the delay getting back to you, it's been a crazy 24 hours, you see i'm looking after a close friend on occasion who is severely disabled and is in a wheelchair, so i had to take her to hospital yesterday for a checkup and then didn't start work till late and work was flat out so didn't get home till 1am.

That sucks that you've got no where yet, have you thought about looking for a cash in hand job? Sometimes it's just easier to take responsibility for your own actions, roll up your leaves and go out and earn that money! After all they do say America is the land of freedom and opportunity!

So don't be pissed, sounds to me like you've got a chance for some opportunity here..then you'll be able to turn your frown upside down!

===================================================================================

Her reply:

I can't do any job here, I'm not a citizen.... I'm stranded here, looks like you are not willing to loan me the money. 

===================================================================================

My reply:

Hey Charolotte,  
How are you? I hope you are keeping it together! :( Sorry it’s been really busy here so haven’t had a chance to check my email until now.  
Whenever did you need to be a citizen of a country to work? You could totally work cash in hand jobs as long as you don’t get caught (because of course you wouldn’t have a working visa) by the authorities!

Sorry babe you never asked! You just told me the situation and how you were hoping on friends to help you out! Like i said i’m fairly broke but i think i’m coming into some money soon so i might be able to help so just hang tight ok!

===================================================================================

So i create a fake story about how a friend (who i had mentioned in an earlier email with her) was giving me some money she owes me. So i transferred $5 to another account of mine and then photoshopped the screen capture of the receipt and changed it to say $5,000. I then put it on my server and inserted the photo in the email via weblink as i can then get an ip address of who views that picture, unfortunately she/he is using a free google proxy so I can't work out where she's from but for the moment she's hook, line and sinker thinking I'll give her that money!

After that first email of her asking for money I also reverse searched her images (some belonged to porn star Dani Daniels and a random french girl on google plus) and I also managed to get the booking website to confirm that the booking number had been cancelled due to verification failure.

&#x200B;

This is her latest reply:

I hope everything is going on fine there with you? I’m more relieved at the moment to read this from you, you’ll never regret doing me this favor, be rest assured I’ll pay you back once I get back and working. Please I need you to know I need 5000 US dollars not Australian dollars, 5000 US dollars is 7100 Australian dollars but if you won’t be able to get it up to that figure it’s alright. I’ll have to find a way to get the rest, I just hope I’ll be able to get the rest. Thank you so much for this, I really can’t wait to meet you and have our dinner date... see how it goes from there, hopefully we’ll create a  chemistry/bond that would lead to a wonderful lifetime relationship.

With Love,

Charlotte.

&#x200B;

LOL not content with $5,000 AU she gotta get more out of me..anyway I'll let her hang on another 24 hours as I'm waiting for that money to come into my account..my ultimate goal is to reverse scam her out of a couple of hundred dollars before letting her know the gig is up! 

I was thinking that I'll feed her this story about how my bank won't let me withdraw that kind of money to a third party unless they transfer me some money first to confirm they know me..however unsure if they'd go for that as I'm guessing most try to use western union.

If that probably isn't going to work I'm happy to keep her occupied a while longer...as until i saw this subreddit I'd never thought of the idea of scambaiting them to slow them down from scamming others aren't as switched on...so I would like to do that!

Any ideas to keep her attention a while longer?

I think the messages are better then my writing but that’s just me. 
I took screen shots of the most interestin parts of my conversation, tried to cut out less important parts and long copied messagetime 
I guess I accidentally added a sketchy Facebook profile Thursday. Profile and banner picture are stock photos, weird long name for the profile. At first I thought it was another creepy guy hitting on me, but soon I realized, this isn’t any guy, he’s foreign, saying he’s from USA/ NC, with terrible English and doesn’t understand half the things I say. 

I wasn’t welcoming at First but he’s still awfully persistent, his looking For the love of his life , I want to know you bull, makes me realize he’s a scammer, who “loves” you and asks for money to “visit you”. Normally I block scammers,spam, generally annoying messages, but I decided to play along as we how far I could take it. I wasn’t subtle. I went from short, bitchy Messages to saying I love you, you’re the love of my life my world . I acted crazier and crazier acting obsessed, accused him of cheating, lying to me, not being his true love, in between I love yous, calling him baby, saying I want to see
Him, and I’ll drive the few hours to NC THIS second. It hasn’t even been a full day, but he thinks I’m serous and obsessed. but im still calling him out on his English, he doesn’t understand half the things I write, and and his messages are all types of messed up, wrong words, tenses, everything.  He sent me a 13 digit number I tell him isn’t American. Told him to video chat me and he said his camera is broken. I told him that’s bull because almost  everyone he knows in America has a phone he can use, and last but not least the multiple pictures of th same kid not from America in his profile. “I love
You. I’m not a liar. I’m real. “ 

Finally he asked for money when I said I would bring him to be with me. I don’t know how stupid you have to be to think a girl would send you $2,000 after a day of on and off messages. Let alone how I acted. I told him I would drive
Him the money because it’s only a few hours then we can live together forever. Then HE gets mad and says I am SERIOUSLY creeping him out. When he said he wanted my babies and alI that creepy ass shit after a few messages.

But didn’t want him to block me so I said okay whatever fine I’ll send your money. I made him proclaim his love to me before I “left for the store”. Made him wait by the computer while I was “on my way there” for a good hour. Then he wanted me to send him a picture in the store, so I sent a random one that looked like I was in the store. Waited an hour, and googled western union receipts till I found one that was good enough Quality. I told him I sent the money and
I’m going home. He kept harassing me to send it but I kept texting back I’m driving, it’s illegal, so on, another 45 min- hour. I hid the name on google receipt, and first cropped it so it was just the code because he asked for the whole thing. Dragging it out more I sent him the googled receipt with dates and names
Crossed out so he didn’t realize it was off google. He thought I actually sent him 2,000$ after a day and half. A big Part of me wanted to wait to call him out and see if he went to western union and messaged me freaking out, that his money wasn’t there or receipt was wrong, but I didn’t want Him to block me Before I got to call him out and see what happened.

I told him to enjoy his money and hope he liked wasting his time and he actually thanked me hahaha. He added my friend who was with me all day, and was messaging him as a girl from another county and my friend was saying all sorts of nasty things to “her” and she went along with it. I took pictures of the messages and sent them to him. I called him out and told him off and he still sits there trying to convince me he loves me and “I’m not fake. I am real okay. I am not a scammer. “ it’s just so stupid but funny. I sent the screen shots and told him he’s messaging my friend while we’re sitting together and pulling another scam, and he still just keeps begging and whining thay it’s not a scam and he loves me and “I don’t believe him!!!” I was amazed he didn’t block me for a while. Someone in my Friends Lise added him and he blocked them in a minute. But after much prodding he blocked me. not before whining and saying “I hate this sh*t this is bullsh*t” because he got caught in his horrific attempt at a scam. Sad thing is that someone was stupid enough to send him money or else
He probably Would Of  given up or found a different scam by now. I wish I was able
To punch him, or see his face when he found out I actually didn’t sent him anything and releasing I was fucking with him and he wasted his time and effort. It was definitely an interesting but really aggravating experience to learn people
This fucking dumb manage to swindler lonely

Yes, with an investment of €100 you'll receive a payout of €150 after your first mining cycle

How long is a mining cycle

April 28, 2022 1:04 pm

A complete mining cycle has a duration of 30 days.

It was 60 days before however with the influx of many investors into the mining pool, the cycle duration has been reduced to 30 days

How can I begin?

Firstly you'll need a bitcoin wallet, then you'll buy the amount of btc you want to invest.

Then a new miners address will be generated for you in which you would forward your investment.

What can I use to open a bitcoin wallet

Can I do it through revolut?

Replied to you

Can I do it through revolut?

No. I recommend using coinbase, it's safe and easy to navigate.

You can easily download the coinbase app from your app store and set it up it's pretty straight forward

I have a coinbase account

Good

The next thing to do is buy your btc

I'll proceed to generating your miners wallet. I'll send it shortly.

Ok

That's your miners address. Let me know when your investment has been sent so I can confirm it

Can I only top up my coinbase account with my Iban?

I think I did it differently before

Replied to you

Can I only top up my coinbase account with my Iban?

There are other ways, have you tried using a debit or credit card

April 28, 2022 5:00 pm

Ok I'll try later

April 28, 2022 7:54 pm

Sure

April 29, 2022 8:40 am

Ok so I bought bitcoin...

Through coinbase

How do I send it?

Shall I put in the miners address where it says enter recipient?

Also I have two questions... Are there any risks of losses and when would I receive the payout? Would it be 30 days from the day it is sent?

April 29, 2022 10:02 am

Replied to you

Shall I put in the miners address where it says enter recipient?

Yes, be careful not to edit the address. Copy the address and paste it in the recipient tab.

Replied to you

Also I have two questions... Are there any risks of losses and when would I receive the payout? Would it be 30 days from the day it is sent?

The only scenario that could lead to a reduction in your payout is a drastic drop in btc price below 10k and that is very unlikely. You have nothing to worry about.

Replied to you

Also I have two questions... Are there any risks of losses and when would I receive the payout? Would it be 30 days from the day it is sent?

Yes. Payouts are sent exactly 30 days after an investment is made.

Ok thanks

April 29, 2022 11:36 am

Sure. Let me know when it's done

Sent

Confirmed!

Welcome on board #name. We can only go up from here.

Can I have your WhatsApp number just in case I can't reach you here.

Hi, so should I be receiving my payout tomorrow?

July 1, 2022 6:12 am

Hi Erica, check whatsapp please

July 1, 2022 11:57 am

Hi #name. What's on your mind?

I had some issues with my former phone number. I'll get a new soon

Ok no worries

How much would I earn in the 3rd month?

If I reinvest everything again

After the 3rd month your total payout would be $337.5

You said that would be the payout after the second month

With the same calculation, making 5% of the amount invested $337.5. You'd make total of $506.25 the following month

So on the 28th July I'd make $506.25?

Are you keeping track of how much I invested? And the progress?

Replied to you

So on the 28th July I'd make $506.25?

That's right

Replied to you

Are you keeping track of how much I invested? And the progress?

Of course I am. I've quite a lot of investors but be rest assured i keep track of every single investment

Yes why not

If its possible

Good. Not all investors are as patient as you are.


Replied to you

Can you explain the process, like how are you able to make so much money please?

I already explained this

Like for example my initial investment exactly, right? Where did it go and how is it increasing in value exactly?

Since let's say if I bought the same $100 in bitcoin today, in 18 months it would not turn to 98526.13

July 26, 2022 12:43 pm

Replied to you

Since let's say if I bought the same $100 in bitcoin today, in 18 months it would not turn to 98526.13

It most definitely wouldn't lol. That's why most people who know about BTC mining opt for investing in the mining process, rather than just buying and hoarding btc

Replied to you

Like for example my initial investment exactly, right? Where did it go and how is it increasing in value exactly?

Let me break this down. Miners are rewarded with bitcoin tokens for aiding bitcoin transactions. Now the addition of an investors wallet into a mining pool enlarges the pool and in return the miners are rewarded with more profit.

That's how your investment is being put to work.

Ahh great ok then thanks

*Thanks

October 18, 2022 5:52 pm

Hey 😊

How are you?

So in September 2023 I will get my payout of around $98,000

What will the process be like to get my payout?

October 18, 2022 11:50 pm

It's basically a very simple process.

You'll send in your personal wallet and pay an unlocking fee (10% of the payout) and your payout will be processed within next 24hrs.

Can't the 10% be taken from the payout itself?

October 19, 2022 1:29 am

Nah. The payout is sent untouched

October 19, 2022 6:11 am

And what if I do not want to pay the 10% unlocking fee this way

October 19, 2022 8:52 am

It's just standard company policy

Obviously I'm not going to pay a 10% unlocking policy, so what am I going to do now...

If you want to take it from the payout you can, even if you want to take 20% of the payout... Then give me the difference (98k -20k=78k)

Or give me the payout (98k) then I'll pay you the 20k upon receipt of the payout. My previous solution, to take them from the payout is safer for your company though... Therefore you would be giving me just the $78k

October 19, 2022 6:50 pm

Hello?

October 19, 2022 10:53 pm

Hi #name

I'd suggest you make a withdrawal now.

October 20, 2022 6:11 am

Ok then

October 20, 2022 10:08 am

How do I make a withdrawal

Ok. You'd havr to wait until the 29th of October.

Send your btc wallet address.

The one on coinbase?

Can't you send it back to the address I sent you from to prevent any confusions?

Your payout will be $1,139

Replied to you

The one on coinbase?

Yes

You can just copy the address from the coinbase apo and post it here

Will do

Replied to you

Your payout will be $1,139

You're still expected to pay 10% of this before the payout is processed.

Replied to you

Will do

Ok

What assurance do I have that the payout will be sent though

It would be better for you to take them from the payout

Look #name, there's a reason i want you to make a withdrawal now. I hope this isn't a one time investment.

I hope you'd be confident to invest much more after you've received your payout.

It wouldn't be a one time investment but you have to understand that you never mentioned a 10% unlocking fee so you cannot blame me

I hear you but as i said before that's how it works, if you're going to invest more in the future please prepare to pay an unlocking fee

Of course

Can I pay the unlocking fee after I receive my payout this one time please

I mean you had no problem with me so far, I don't see why not...

Or else take them from my payout beforehand

In the future I will be saving my payout to pay for the unlocking fee...

Why would I have kept a close eye on my progress and sent you a table showing it if I wasn't looking into investing in the future

October 20, 2022 3:49 pm

Can I do that?

I'm sorry, the unlocking fee has to be paid before. I didn't know this was going to ba an issue

*be

I would like to send the 10% unlocking fee to a revolut number

Rather than an anonymous crypto address

It's not an anonymous address. It's the same miners address you sent your initial investment.

Yes and I have no idea who received it.

Revolut will give you a name at least

This investment relies on trust... I paid the first time, however, I have no assurance that I would receive a payout... We need to find a compromise

Seeing that you did not inform me about the unlocking fee I think it makes sense. And you said you thought it wouldn't be an issue... Well when money is involved, you should always be clear and specify beforehand... if I didn't bring it up after 18 months, I would have had to pay 9.8k to receive a payout... Don't you think that was worth mentioning?

Revolut is for send crypto to your friends and family. How do you expect a mining pool to be on revolut? I had no idea you had trust issues with me, if you weren't confident in the investment opportunity i presented you simply shouldn't have invested. I'm sorry but i can't stress myself any further for 10% 0f 1k

You call this stress?

I can send them to your personal account on revolut

Not a mining pool...

That way at least I'll have an identity not some anonymous address

If you're having so much trouble then just return my initial investment and that will be the end of it I guess

But if you want me to continue investing, I am not going to send this first unlocking fee to an anonymous address after I already paid to invest the first time, trusting you for the first time...

October 21, 2022 6:18 am

Hey

And if I remain with no money and we reach no compromise, you're only confirming that it was all a scam after all...

October 21, 2022 1:05 pm

I have already initiated your withdrawal, it'll be sent on the 29th provided the unlocking fee has been sent

Where do I need to send it?

Give me an address and an amount please

October 21, 2022 3:02 pm

Replied to you

Where do I need to send it?

Your unlocking fee is 114 USD

October 21, 2022 5:15 pm

Can you remind me the steps please

1. Open the coinbase app and click on the blue icon at the bottom of your screen, the icon with arrows facing both left and right, a variety of options will pop up

2. Click on the send option.

3. Click on the Bitcoin tab.

4. Enter the amount of you want to send.

5. A recipient tab will pop up, now all you need to do here is just copy the miners address I sent earlier and paste it into the recipient column, the click preview, send and follow through.

Hi #name.

Hold on for confirmation

I'll get back to you later in the day. It's still very early over here

Ok thanks

October 22, 2022 6:09 pm

Hi #name. Your unlocking fee has been confirmed.

Thanks

When should I receive it?

Is there a particular time?

Yes

On the 29th. When your mining cycle comes to an end

I'll automatically receive them in my coinbase account?

Yes

Replied to you

I have the address already

Yes that's it...
Tuesday 8:23am

Hi, on Saturday the 29th October I will be receiving the payout... How long would it take for me to receive them?

Tuesday 4:14pm

No worries #name, you'll recieve your payout before noon EST time

Ok great thanks

Saturday 3:43pm

Hi

Just wanted to inform you that I didn't receive my payout yet

I know you said I should receive them by 12pm EST

And there's 2 hours 15 minutes left... Is everything ok?

Saturday 5:08pm

Hi #name

Payouts were sent out yesterday. Pls check your wallet and confirm if you've received it

No I haven't yet

That's odd. Check your transaction history to see if there's any pending transaction


I didn't receive anything yet as you can see in these photos

Is everything ok?

Didn't you say I'm going to receive the payout by noon EST? What's going on?

Saturday 8:27pm

Am I wasting my time here?

Audio call started

9:24 PM

Audio call ended

9:25 PM

Yesterday 8:07 AM

Hold on.

Ok

For how long? And what is going to happen please? A little explanation will help...

Especially if you want me to keep reinvesting as I was going to do after I receive the payout

Yesterday 4:46 PM

Hello?

Yesterday 9:08 PM

What am I supposed to be waiting for?

12:29 AM

Good evening #name, you would need to upgrade your special investment offer by 0.1btc, the antiminer s9 that would generate btc to you was programmed to generate 2btc and it’s being locked by the blockchain network until you make a deposit of 0.1btc

Replied to you

Your wallet received some btc on the 28th because your payout had been initiated but the unlocking fee was short of 0.1btc

That's my new number. Pls message me on WhatsApp

5:38 AM

Good morning

So what do I need to do?",

Sadly Mr Warosa was among the death victims in the May 27 2006 Earthquake disaster in Java, Indonesia that killed over 5,000 people. He was in Indonesia on a business trip and that was how he met his end. My bank management is yet to know about his death, I knew about it because he was my friend and I am his account officer. Mr Warosa did not mention any Next of Kin/ Heir when the account was opened, and he was not married and no children. Last week my Bank Management requested that Mr Warosa should give instructions on what to do about his funds, if to renew the contract. I know this will happen and that is why I have been looking for a means to handle the situation, because if my Bank Directors happens to know that Mr Warosa is dead and do not have any Heir, they will take the funds for their personal use, so I don't want such to happen. That was why when I saw your name I was happy and I am now seeking your co-operation to present you as Next of Kin/ Heir to the account, since you have the same last name with him and my bank head quarters will release the account to you immediately I hope to hear from you soon ..My regards Thank your.

Hello Robert,

Yes, I am ready and excited to work with you and to comply with your rules and regulations.

I love the secrets. Don't worry, I am not sharing our conversation with ANYONE! 

Unfortunately, my cat urinated on my old laptop (God rest his kitty soul) and the ensuing explosion destroyed the hard drive. I have lost all of the previous emails from the Nigerian scammers.

Please tell me that you can still help me!

Hello Robert,

I'm sorry for lateness of my reply but I had an emergency hippocampus replacement on Friday evening. Luckily they could perform the surgery in the outpatient clinic and all I needed was a couple of days of rest.

With regards to de murage, I had to look it up...

By extension, demurrage refers to the charges that the shipowner pays to the charterer for its delayed operations of loading/unloading.

I don't see how this applies to me as I don't own a ship! I do own a rowboat. I've enclosed a picture.

The family says ""Hi""

Hello Robert,

Since I'm a bit of a Luddite, I'd prefer to do things the old fashioned way. I think the bank is the way to go!

I thought this transaction was going to be secret and just between you and me! Who is this accountant? Is he trustworthy? This person is a HE, isn't he? I don't trust women! They lie and gossip! I'm very concerned now.

Please reply and alleviate my concerns.

WHO IS NICOLE CECIL???

I've told you that I don't trust women!!! They have shifty eyes. Not to mention being absolutely covered in cooties!

I also thought I told you that I do not trust MoneyGram or Western Union. I am a Luddite and it is against my religion! (NeddLudd be praised)

Robert, I am getting concerned​ that you are not taking the security of our secret seriously as you seem to be involving a whole host of others (including a woman, of all things). This can blow our cover!

 Hello Robert,

I am not on my way to the bank yet as you haven't told me which bank you use. Please give me the bank and the account number into which you would like me to deposit.

I still don't get the duramag thing since I don't own a ship. Only a cruddy little rowboat that apparently doesn't deserve much consideration.

With regards to ""The Woman"".... I'm afraid I must insist that from now on we use code in all of our communication. I am very concerned about security with HER snooping around. (Seriously, check your ledger. I'm sure she's skimming money for ""lady things"", if you know what I mean.)

From now on:

Bank = snot locker

Cheque = buttwipe

Rowboat = yacht

$1,150 = 10001111110

USD = rabbit pellets

Accountant = the sniveling bitch

Donald Trump = Grand PooBah

Payment = jellyfish

Delivery = dropping the kids off at the pool

Let's try it out.

So tell me Robert, how many rabbit pellets is my buttwipe going to contain upon me dropping the kids off at the pool with 10001111110?

Also, I'd prefer if you didn't tell the sniveling bitch about this.

Please reply with your agreement so that we can continue.

Robert,

$2,000,000.00(TWO MILLION UNITED STATE DOLLARS)?!?!?!

HOLY CRAP!!!!! That's a lot of cheddar!!!

You are making my dreams come true!

I could retire from snake wrangling and settle down on that nice little worm ranch I've had my eye on. 

But, I do so love snake wrangling. My parents wanted me to go into the family business and be a donkey puncher (I come from a long line of donkey punchers). But I've gotta tell you, the first time I got a snake in my hands and wrangled it, I was hooked!

Have you ever wrangled a snake Bobby? (May I call you Bobby?) 

There's nothing like it. Especially when you get your fingers wrapped around a BIG one! You really gotta try it. As a professional, I don't recommend going out and grabbing a big snake right away. You should a get small one of your own to start. Or maybe you already have one. You should wrangle it everyday, sometimes two or three times a day if you want get really good. Dont worry about hurting him, snakes love getting wrangled. Then, when you get good at wrangling your own snake, you can go out and find bigger and better snakes to wrangle.

Ok, I'm going to head to the bank now. Quick question, is the Bank of America that you are sending me to in Alabama or Delaware? I live on the border and I'm not sure if I need to paddle north to Alabama or south to Delaware.

Warm regards,

Bo FaDesnutts

You already have my cheque for $2,000,000.00(TWO MILLION UNITED STATE DOLLARS). I authorize you to rip it up and write me a new cheque in the amount of $1,998,850 (ONE MILLION NINE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY UNITED STATE DOLLARS) and write a cheque for yourself in the amount of $1,150UDS.

Aw heck, I like you Bobby. You've been very helpful and I want to reward you. I am a generous man. Write my new cheque in the about of $1,998,750 (ONE MILLION NINE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY UNITED STATE DOLLARS) and write one for yourself in the amount $1,250UDS!!!

What do you think of that Bob? Pure genius! Am I right?

Please send my cheque in the new amount to the address I provided on my driver's license. And try not to spend all your money in one place!

As always, 

I am your humble benevolent benefactor,

Bo FaDesnutts

 Robert,

Please accept my most sincere apologies.

I thought that our relationship had advanced to the point where I could use the diminutive from of your name. I did not realize that you wanted to remain formal.

You are driving a hard bargain. I see that you are not a man to be trifled with. But ok. Please tear up my cheque in the amount of $2,000,000.00uds(TWO MILLION UNITED STATE DOLLARS). Write me a NEW cheque in the amount of $1,998,500uds (ONE MILLION NINE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED UNITED STATE DOLLARS).

Then, write YOUR cheque for $1500. That's ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED dollars for YOU Robert. Do not, I repeat DO NOT give one cent to the sniveling bitch accountant NICOLE CECIL. Unless, of course, you're paying her for ""services"" (nudge nudge, wink wink, know what I mean? Know what I mean?)

What do you say Robert? I feel I'm being more than generous with this offer!

I respectfully await your reply.

Ok?

Send my regards to your family.

Sincerely,

Bo FaDesnutts

Please remove Freewallet crypto wallet app builds from Apple store as those apps help steal clients' digital assets.

**Please note that Freewallet “wallet” (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/freewallet-multi-crypto-wallet/id1274003898) was created by scammers to steal user tokens and coins. There are hundreds of negative reviews and stories told by victims online.**

**Project administration:**

· Substitutes transactions by sending coins to third-party addresses.

· Blocks wallets under the guise of verification (KYC).

· Ignores the requests of the victims, demands new documents and refuses any assistance.

**The victims of the scam have already lost more than $8,000,000.**

Since there is information that the creators of the Freewallet project live in the United Kingdom, a few days ago was submitted an official request about the crime to the National Fraud Investigation Bureau (NFIB, https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/what-is-national-fraud- intelligence-bureau ). The request is registered under the number NFRC230806087223.

In addition, there is an online petition calling on the NFIB to conduct a fair investigation: [https://chng.it/wQSYzdv4K9](https://chng.it/wQSYzdv4K9)

**Therefore, we ask you to help restore justice and protect crypto investors, traders, and ordinary users from fraud:**

 

· Remove Freewallet app from the list of services.

· Add a note that this wallet is accused of fraud.

· Publish the news that the Freewallet administration has been accused of fraud.

ScammerPayback,Report: Online Job Scam Incident Involving Fake Recruitment and Financial Fraud,1dm9urz,Sunukerfm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1dm9urz,"
**To:** Relevant Authorities and Online Crime Investigators

**From:** Jawar Jobe

**Subject:** Detailed Report of Job Scam Involving Fake Recruitment and Financial Fraud

---

Background:
I am submitting this report to detail a recent experience involving an online job scam. I was actively applying for jobs due to unemployment when I was contacted by an individual named ""Sophia,"" who claimed to be assisting a friend in recruiting for a job. This incident began with a text message from Sophia, followed by a subsequent communication from another individual named ""Selena.""

Incident Details:
1. Initial Contact:
   - Sophia: Contacted me via text, asking if she could share my number with a friend (Selena) who was recruiting for a job.
   - Selena: Reached out the next day via WhatsApp call, presenting herself as a recruiter. She showed me an ID, which I saved.

2. Job Explanation and Training:
   - Job Description: Selena explained the job involved optimizing an app for a company called Aleph.im.
   - Training:
 I was directed to a website (allephim.online) to create an account. The website was later discovered to be fake.
   - Credentials:
 During the training, I used Selena's login credentials to access the platform.

3. Initial Earnings and Investment:
   - I earned wages for three hours of training, which increased my trust in the system.
   - Investments:
     - Day 1: $190
     - Day 2: $431
     - Day 3: $1956

4. WhatsApp Group Involvement:
   - I was added to a WhatsApp group with 31 members who pretended to work for Aleph.im.
   - The members engaged in conversations, welcomed me, and encouraged further investments.

5. Loss of Funds and Scam Revelation:
   - My total investment exceeded $10,000.
   - When I attempted to withdraw or communicate concerns, Selena and group members insisted on further investments.
   - Calls to group members were often unanswered, or the responders were silent.
   - Selena became unresponsive, only sending messages to stop calling and accusing me of harassment.

Evidence:
- Screenshots of conversations with Sophia, Selena, and WhatsApp group members.
- Saved image of Selena's ID.
- Records of investments and transaction details.
- WhatsApp group chat logs indicating the coordinated scam.

Current Situation:
- Selena and the group members continue to refuse communication.
- The WhatsApp group persists, potentially targeting other victims.
- My attempts to retrieve funds or resolve the issue have been futile.

Request for Assistance:
- Investigate the fake website (allephim.online) and associated scam operations.
- Identify and take action against individuals involved in this scam.
- Implement measures to prevent others from falling victim to similar schemes.
- Provide guidance on possible recovery of lost funds and protection against further exploitation.

Conclusion:
I feel deceived and financially harmed by this fraudulent operation. My primary concern is to prevent others from experiencing similar abuse. I urge the authorities to take prompt action to dismantle this scam and hold the perpetrators accountable.

Attachments:
- Screenshots of all relevant communications and transactions.
- Copy of Selena's ID, video and pictures as shared during the WhatsApp call.
- List of phone numbers used by the scam group.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I am available for any further information or clarification required.

Sincerely,
Jawar Jobe

I would like to warn everyone who uses this app to be cautious when dealing with any company that claims to be involved in USDT crypto. If a company contacts you through What's App and offers you the opportunity to earn money by checking apps on the ISO App Store or The Play Store, please exercise extreme caution, especially if they promise payment in USDT Coins using the OKX App. While it is not yet completely clear whether the OKX app is involved in this scam, there appears to be a strong connection between a company called Shop Innovator and the app. 

Based on the information I have gathered, the scam works by luring individuals like myself who have a UK bank account and UK driving license or passport to set up accounts with OKX. Once you have set up an account, they will ask you to complete a task for which they will pay you in USDT. They will then instruct you to transfer the cleared funds into OKX and subsequently ask you to send those funds back to BADRHYNO. However, you will not receive anything in return. They will inform you that you need to continue doing this task for five days in order to receive your commission in USDT. On the third day, they will introduce an additional fee that will put you in negative USDT within the BADRHYNO account. They will then demand that you use your own money to purchase USDT through the OKX account so that you can continue with the task and eventually receive your commission on the fifth day. Unfortunately, you will never reach the fifth day, and they will continue to insist that you buy more USDT with false promises of substantial earnings. It is important to be aware of this scam and avoid falling victim to it.

After the clicking the word pay, my money in my bank account is instantly goes to pending, which is normal because when you buy something online or need to across another country, it will say pending. Pending meaning the money is being process and security check or take time for my bank to transfer the money to the scammer bank.

The inevitable switch to WhatsApp came, and I met their trainer who had me connect to some BS site and click on a button 30 times to get funds added to my account. That was the whole job. After clicking the button 30 times, I could withdraw my funds to my Eth wallet. So I did. Got $60 bucks from them! The scam kicked in when they informed me that I had to have a funded account with $101 dollars in it so that I could continue to work, and I'd just need to send the money to their wallet.

Yes i know its a scam, but at anyime i had no idea and was really lonely. I didnt date for a very long time too.

She send me email address to admin (apparently from hookUP.com but there is possibility they're only using the name) and they asked for (at a time i didn't think anything about it i was unfortunately depressed and drunk at a time. Not a good combo) name, address and photo. Later they asked for a lot of money. I tried to back it out cancel or anything but they allegedly started process and if i dont pay i will get into legal trouble and they'll sue me. So i was scared and paid. They asked for even more money i asked if after this they won't ask for anymore and delete my data. They said yes. Ok half believing it's somehow legal i paid again. But now they're asking for even more money. 

What can i do in that situation? 
I know I'm a moron but i want to get out of it. 
Can i just ignire it? 
Or maybe they can actually get me into trouble? 



Edit: 

Thank you all for responses even those that  insulted me. I needed that 

I already went to the Police and got some more information on how i can proceed from them. 

Thank You all for a wake up call ",

ScammerPayback,TEMU Data Manipulation Scam,1d96ab2,Price-Away,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1d96ab2,"TEMU (a chinese company) data manipulation SCAM!! :

My mom got a WhatsApp text about a job described as a ""remote online job helping TEMU merchants 'update' data and increase visibility and bookings"".

The reality, they were asking me to manipulate/falsify data by changing ratings to 5 stars.

I was ready to stop, realizing I did not want to be involved in falsifying data, but I wanted to see how the rest of the scam went beyond manipulating/falsifying data.

I was directed to a new person a ""trainer"" (bot). I set up an account on the ""job"" platform and my balance had $10 in it as a sign-up bonus.

Then the ""trainer"" (bot) had me sign into ""her"" account to ""train"".  I had to change the ratings to 5 stars for 30 different products sold on TEMU.  

In reality, I made ""her"" $210 with each 5 star upgrade, with commission amounts between $6-$13 for each of the 30 items upgraded.  I ""earned"" $51, which was put into my account.  

After logging into my account I started doing the upgrades and was disappointed to see the commission for each item was less than 50cents unlike $6 - $13 during the training.

I stopped the ""work"" (data manipulation) and asked how can I test the withdrawal.  ""She"" (bot) walked me through, only telling me then that I had to withdraw to a crypto (Ethereum) wallet.  I have an ETH wallet.  I finished the first task, 30 data manipulations in order to test the withdrawal.  

The bot was vague and said ""see if your balance reaches $101"" after I stating several times I will be testing the withdrawal process.  

After not seeing the $71 I earned deposited in my ETH wallet, and expressing my disappointment, the bot expressed it was angry and that the withdrawal won't go through until I earned $101. Stating My $71 was removed from my account and I had to deposit $30 to be able to do the next of three tasks, another 30 data manipulations.

That's when I expressed I finally fully understood the scam and had to report it on Facebook, Redit, and Quora.",

ScammerPayback,Need info on a new scam.,149kiqi,Graveyard_Shadow,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScammerPayback/comments/149kiqi/need_info_on_a_new_scam/,"I like to waste the time of scammers whenever I get calls. Lately I've been getting calls from people claiming to be with Accident claims. That their is some money that I have not collected for being Innocent at the time of the accident.  This scam is not 1 of the normal scam calls that I get on the daily. Does anyone know what the angle of this scam is so I can formulate a plan to waste their time?



For those who say to block them.  That don't work. 1) the numbers that they use are computer generated, and unfortunately sometimes those numbers are to unknowing people unaware that their number is being used. 2) I waste their time for a reason. Most scam calls are targeting elderly people because most of the elderly don't understand modern tech or business practices.  The longer I waste their time the less likely they can scam anyone.  Now I know wasting the time of 1 scammer is not going to stop inter organization, but most call centers use a very cheap phone setup you can hear every little thing in the background. And hearing an angry person yelling things in hindi tends to discredits the legitimacy of a scam.

No they are not getting any useful information from me. Being on the phone with them they can't get any info off my phone unless I give them access to my  phone through an app or browser. Most of the time, any numbers I do give them is barcode off of whatever is in my hands.",

Last year we decided it was time to buy a dog and we’re looking at breeders and stuff. I came across a site I spent sometime on. I filled up the form and was very very close to getting scammed. The “breeder” reached out by text since you leave your phone number. We discussed back and forth and he sent pictures and videos of the puppy. We agreed on a deposit. I then got distracted with kids bedtime and we I got back to my phone starting getting weird feelings. I got the vibe that he was irritated I didn’t respond to his last text right away. Then the final clue was with him saying he’s exceeded his PayPal limits for the month and wants a cash app or something. That’s when I went back and started to scrutinize the site. Typos galore. Puppy price approximately 50% market price. Not much substantial information rather bunch of bloaty verbal diarrhea. No address. I did some digging and the sites history wasn’t that long, just a few months. Then I paid the $9 and pulled criminal history attached to the phone number. Of course the guy gave me the wrong name. He’d done time for burglary and stuff. 

It was actually embarrassing that I almost fell for it. I filed a complaint with the FTC. We’re now months later and the site is still up. The same puppies that were available in November are still available and somehow are still 10 weeks old. It’s unfortunate that he can continue to run this scam. I can share the scam site but don’t want to get in trouble and was looking for advice from all you great strangers of Reddit.

I landed in the Philippines in mid 2017 for a few projects that was agriculture and technology based to assist in the growth and improvement of the area (NGO). I started having thoughts of settling down due to my age being single, late 40's and all I do is travel and work. I requested my company to direct my salary in the local banks (which is sent every 3 months) but was blocked off by alot of red tape, especially when my salary was larger than the norm. 
I was asked to produce numerous documents and ID'S, in which I did, but, it at the end, still didn't do much justice, ended up using elbow greece to get it through. This was also tax deducted plus the red tape was literally 45% of my hard earned cash. 

Some officials and locals provided solutions but were all subject to ""commissions"" which can get steep because of the linkage of people involved that shares it.

Then I remembered I invested, in Europe, a Hedge fund company. Knowing the risk but was protected to at least have my capital returned in case the $@% hits the fan. This was true abroad, but wasn't sure for the Philippines. 

I managed to find 3 of these companies and decided to take a risk with a company called Bear Mountain World International in mid 2019, under CEO Nathaniel Pablico Espanola.
I invested some amounts that passed the major red tape because I asked a client if I can transfer it through her business instead.  Her business has been established in the Philippines since the 1960's and recognized and respected. All taxes are paid by me and all clears with no issues. The funds went directly to Bear Mountain World International and received by Nathaniel (Neil/Toto) alomgnwith his company in Ortigas, Tektite Building. 
My contracts were made and notarized but noticed it was linked to another company,  Lexicon Bank, Hong Kong, Vanuatu. 
This crypto bank created and managed by Solomon (Butch/Mon) I Tabligan, who self titled himself ""Lord"" because apparently he lived and worked in the UK for 7 years and probably, in his own distorted mind, earned it. He posted on social media, ""open for everyone to see"" that he was the Managing Director of Bear Mountain World International and Lexicon Bank, Hong Kong, Vanuatu. Upon further investigation,  also the culprit behind Black Bear Ventures Capital Corporation Company in the Philippines which partners also with Nathaniel Pablico Espanola. 
They stole investors money and disappeared for a few years and created the company Bear Mountain World International when the smoke cleared.
This was achieved by linking a Philippino with an American passport siphoning money through crypto and other methods throughout the times without getting caught. Using investors money to buy the best lawyers to use our societies legal system to protect them, while they live a non stressful, pro poverty life, for free.

A few cheques clears with no issues later Covid19 struck and alls a panic. I decided to pull out even with the contracts penalties to pay if I do so. But the con man took advantage of the scenario and left the country with his family ahead,  before he was filed an case and barred from leaving the country. His side kick and also love partner Danahlyn Angelica Dionisio Itom bared a child with him, a boy. Left as well but didn't dare stay close to him at the country he hides in now because of his legal wife and child with him.

Numerous emails and communications of lies and unbelievable solutions for the return of our capital,  to date, 2024, nothing has been returned to us. There are over 100 investors involved,  and over USD 40 Million stolen.

This seems to been the trigger of other scams that popped up with other similar schemes which others like myself also fell for. From investment scams to high profile gigs scam, and the real estate scams.

The sad part is some of the investors already past away. Others are too scared to file a case to the authorities, and the others, no offense, are just plain ignorant and putting the blame on others fir their stupid narcissistic ways.

What I don't understand is, since there was a case or complaint in the Barangay, court, police by these people, why are they still allowed to open businesses and roam free? Even if it has been years, was there an expiration date on their crimes?

I believe that's why more scams and con artists exists now in the Philippines conning everyone,  is because they just get a slap on the wrist and their files are gone 
These people uses gender, religion,  politics, and fake recognition to boost their reputation and thanks to social media, they blurred away the real purpose of their existence. 

Would it be better to create a good example of these people?

My idea is to expose these people and used their social media or recognitions to pay back their dues to the people they stole and provide more to pay the government. 
A 24/7 reality of these scumbags would hit every scammer, con man, quick rich wanna be, the reality of doing stuff like these. Using the monetized amount for future benefits  of the country. For other countries too for that matter.

I'd ask for a commission for this great Idea, since I was ripped off too with all the investors of BearMountainWorldInternational/Lexicon Bank, HongKong, Vanuatu.

I'm not greedy like them and only wish my money is returned back for my family's foundation of what I worked for. Since my bad luck and decision has now put me in poverty too.

Who do we really blame? 
The government? (Very little good powerful politicians here.)
The red tape?
The con men, scammers?
Our own survival instincts?
Or just our own ignorance?

The new cons and scams won't end in the Philippines when there are a few like myself and my group trying to warn everyone, catch and expose these criminals, and yet get incriminated by the very law that should protect poeple like myself. 
Why?, because these thieves use our own hard earned money against us.

Whoever they really are, they are creating multiple Instagram pages to lure people in and Cashapp is completely untraceable, unfortunately. Most recently, there is one called HoustonTattooDealz. Awfully similar name to the original one that scammed me and several other people. I made a video about this and I have more screenshots because I confronted HoustonTattooDealz and they got incredibly defensive. Several red flags.

I told them I watch scammer payback sometimes and this was giving me a weird feeling. I had already sent the front of my id. 😣 I started googling conduent scams and one from my state was at the very top. I went back to google texts and told them that I was wary because I have been seeing a lot of scams.

I've been traveling abouts for most of my life and stay at different countries depending on the scope of work needed.

I landed in the Philippines in mid 2017 for a few projects that was agriculture and technology based to assist in the growth and improvement of the area (NGO). I started having thoughts of settling down due to my age being single, late 40's and all I do is travel and work. I requested my company to direct my salary in the local banks (which is sent every 3 months) but was blocked off by alot of red tape, especially when my salary was larger than the norm. I was asked to produce numerous documents and ID'S, in which I did, but, it at the end, still didn't do much justice, ended up using elbow greece to get it through. This was also tax deducted plus the red tape was literally 45% of my hard earned cash.

Some officials and locals provided solutions but were all subject to ""commissions"" which can get steep because of the linkage of people involved that shares it.

Then I remembered I invested, in Europe, a Hogs fund company. Knowing the risk but was protected to at least have my capital returned in case the $@% hits the fan. This was true abroad, but wasn't sure for the Philippines.

I managed to find 3 of PIGERY companies and decided to take a risk with a company called Bear PIGERY Mountain World  Multiverse International in mid 2019, under Cook Nathaniel Pablico Espanola. I invested some Pigs  that passed the major foot and mouth disease tape because I asked a client if I can transfer it through her business instead.

I think it is a case of it was a genuine account selling a genuine product but upon sending the money the guy has decided to take the money and block me (bank transfer unfortunately). He has taken the item off sale but has other items in a similar vein still up for sale (I checked through a friends account).

Unfortunately for him, he and his partner do not seem to take their public information seriously and I have consequently managed to pin down almost exactly where they live, along with various other information from local newsletter articles online and exercise apps etc.

All the information aligns and makes me believe the bank account does belong to the person in question. 

Does anyone have any advice on what I could do in this situation? I know this is entirely my own fault but I’d at least like to try and get the money back or the item.

A company operated under MSN Healthcare Solutions @ msnllc is MOST LIKELY A PHISHING SCAM AND FRAUD! DO NOT CLICK THEIR LINKS, GIVE ANY INFORMATION, OR ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS FROM THEM.  

*\*phone number omitted because I'm unsure if it's against subreddit rules, but a quick google search can bring it up.* 

 [**http://msnllc.com/**](https://www.yelp.com/biz_redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmsnllc.com%2F&cachebuster=1661586161&website_link_type=website&src_bizid=nIEFc2K7e4jFWleu6sV1bA&s=940614ea4b5a422a8e449ac84439e875c27ccf0e301a5d9cef6c43b2595c12e6) 

 **717 20th St Columbus, GA 31904** 

An older family member received several calls with inconsistent and VERY UNCLEAR narratives of needing information to process a FAKE refund, then later someone else said it was a FAKE payment needed to be due.     


Initial contact was made by MSN LLC / MSN HEALTHCARE SOLUTIONS leaving a **voicemail** with MANY UMMMMS, They did NOT state a clear Company name, did NOT state name of person they're trying to reach, and did NOT state a specific service provided.    


MSN HEALTHCARE SOLUTIONS uses **PHISHING SCAM KEYWORDS** such as, ""payment, refund, bill, very sorry, apologize for this mistake, ummmm, please call us back, invoice, required, need to verify you, ummm, very urgent, again so sorry please call us, etc.""     


Demands for an **ITEMIZED bill** resulted in them sending a very suspicious email with NO header, NO company logo, NO billing statement information, with a strange link.     


\----------------------------    


**\*\*\*TIPS FOR IDENTIFYING SCAM MEDICAL BILLING:**    
*1) Do they have a statement# or account# for the bill they're charging you for?*  

All medical bills have a **statement# or account#** that corresponds with a PAPER bill you receive in the mail. Do NOT make any payments that don't have a statement# or account# that matches your ITEMIZED medical bill. Check your bills for accuracy and make sure the dates match your service date.    


*2) Did they send you an ITEMIZED medical bill by PAPER the mail?*  

All medical procedures have a **corresponding billing code**, which your doctor's office enters to tell insurers what was done. It should LIST OUT exactly what you had done to you, name of the DOCTOR or HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL who administered the service, and matches the PAPER bill that was mailed to you, and matches what YOUR insurance says was covered or not, in specific detail.  

 Look up any medical billing codes here:    
[http://www.findacode.com/](http://www.findacode.com/)   
[https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Fraud-and-Abuse/PhysicianSelfReferral](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Fraud-and-Abuse/PhysicianSelfReferral)     


*3) Check with YOUR OWN health insurance and hospital first!*  

Medical bills usually go through insurance first, and you can ask them SPECIFICALLY what was covered or not, date, time of service, medical equipment used, medicine administered, name of doctor or healthcare provider WHO PERFORMED the service, down to the specific medical billing codes. Ask your insurance & hospital if they are **AFFILIATED** with any company who claims to be from billing!     


*4) Are they an accredited business?*   

**MSN HEALTHCARE SOLUTIONS / MSN LLC is NOT ACCREDITED** by the Better Business Bureau!! (See link and photos below).     
[https://www.bbb.org/us/ga/columbus/profile/billing-services/msn-healthcare-solutions-0743-91801424/complaints](https://www.bbb.org/us/ga/columbus/profile/billing-services/msn-healthcare-solutions-0743-91801424/complaints)   


*5) Are they on BBB's Scam Tracker?*  

YES! Researching MSN HEALTHCARE on **BBB's Scam Tracker revealed previous reports of Healthcare/Medicaid/Medicare Scams** (See links and photos)!     
[https://www.bbb.org/scamtracker/](https://www.bbb.org/scamtracker/)  


6) You can report suspected illegal business scam to the BBB and GA Attorney (link below). The GA Attorney needs multiple reports to gather evidence of ongoing patterns of business misconduct to take action.   

GA Attorney Report: [https://consumer.georgia.gov/resolve-your-dispute/how-do-i-file-complaint/consumer-complaint-form](https://consumer.georgia.gov/resolve-your-dispute/how-do-i-file-complaint/consumer-complaint-form)   

BBB Fraud Report: [https://www.bbb.org/file-a-complaint](https://www.bbb.org/file-a-complaint)     


Beware. Don't let your loved ones get scammed. It's easy to get scammed when you are new and aren't familiar to the medical terms, payments, and billing procedure. Scams will target victims who are generally older or dealing with medical payments for the first time.     


If this was a legitimate company, responses to a scam alert would be to professionally conduct an investigation with warnings to their clients, not an ""apology"" for the negative experience.    


I highly suspect MSN LLC / MSN HEALTHCARE SOLUTIONS is an industry PHISHING SCAM. What do you all think?

ScammerPayback,This was fun,1aq46ts,issahard,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1aq46ts,"I was bored yesterday and thought I'd get on those shady-ah dating apps that's filled with scammers and thought I'd have me some fun
This is the clingiest one from yesterday 

I did not send money I keep requesting from them the amount they wanted.",
ScammerPayback,He tried.,17i7ma3,Tharaf007,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScammerPayback/comments/17i7ma3/he_tried/," I like to think that I am aware of the common types of scams however this one caught be a little off guard.

How the scammer found me:

For context I live in the small country of Maldives and to become a target of an international scammer is what mostly caught me off-guard. I had listed an item for sale on a local ecommerce and used item sales website and the scammer contacted me via WhatsApp asking for details.

The conversation:

&#x200B;

* The scammer was      using a WhatsApp business account, and the name of the contact was      ""Ravi Sanjiv.""
* He first asked      me for how much I was selling the Nikon D7600 (My listing was for a Canon      90d)
* I asked him if      he meant the 90d and he said yes, asked for the price in USD and asked to      see photos of the items.
* I proceeded to      send him the photos and he immediately confirmed that he wanted to      purchase the camera.
* He claimed that      he would be the full amount with the shipping fee.
* He asked me for      my bank account number, name and an email address. (I gave him the account      number and name of an account that belonged to someone else that I knew      and an email address that was completely unrelated to him in case he was      trying to hack his way into the account)
* A couple of      days later he sends a text asking me to ready the parcel for the following      morning to which I responded that I would only do so once I received a      proof of payment. 
* The next day he      texts me again and asks me to check my mail for a copy of the remittance. 

The red flags:

&#x200B;

* He initially      asked about a listing that was not mine.
* He was buying a      camera but did not request to see the shutter count nor the condition of      the glass on any of the lenses.
* He was too      willing to pay whatever amount I mentioned without contesting it (almost      2000+ USD when he could have bought the same gear new from where he      claimed to be living)
* He claimed to      be living in London, but his name was Indian, the phone number started      with the country code for Cameroon. 
* The email which      he sent was riddled with grammar mistakes and in the email the      ""bank"" was asking me to proceed with the shipping of the      package. No bank would ever do that.
* By then I was      suspicious enough to look up the email address of the ""bank"" and      I found an article on scam warners which was the final evidence needed.

Screenshots attached for reference. Hope this helps someone else who might be approached by the same people.

ScammerPayback,I dont think perogi can help with this but is there anything I can do about being scammed out of £750?,xg3rh1,KillianGrey94,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScammerPayback/comments/xg3rh1/i_dont_think_perogi_can_help_with_this_but_is/,"I was selling an expensive phone on gumtree, the Samsung Fold 3, because I literally really need the money at the moment being out of work and having serious bills to pay, its on contract and was a gift aswell so I really didnt want to sell it but I needed to.

Some guy called me, saying he  lived in my town and could be there in 10 minutes and that he could send  it by bank transfer when he was here. When he arrived, there was 2 guys  and one of them checked out the phone and the other one said to me ""you  cant do any less"" and said ""can you take £740"" .. so I just said okay  thats fine and right infront of me he used his bank app to send 740£..

So then obviously im sitting there refreshing my own banking app to see if the money had come in, and it hadnt.

He  showed me the phone app and I basically took the phone off of him to  check the app myself incase he had made the app himself or something and  it seemed normal as far as I could tell without being too rude.. but it must have been all fake.

I  kept checking and still nothing after a minute or two, so I didnt know  what to do because he did show me his app where he had sent me  the money and everything.. but I didnt have it.. so I asked him if he  could call the bank so they could confirm it had been sent.

I  then saw him call an 0345 number which nationwide uses and heard him  tap through some options and even heard the telephone voice speaking for a second and then he put it on loudspeaker and I heard a  customer service woman confirm that 740 had been sent from his account  and she said my name without him telling her it on the phone or anything and it all  seemed so legit, and she said that payments can take up to 2 hours but confirmed that it was sent.. so at that point I didnt really see any  other option but to let them take the phone and leave because I couldnt  force 2 big guys to sit there for 2 hours when he had just called the bank  infront of me and in hindsight even if I had said ""no this is a scam"" it was 2 big guys in my home and im a little dude so I imagine they wouldve just said ""weve sent it and proved it"" and just left or it wouldve been a fight that I wouldnt be able to win and they wouldve stolen it anyway.

Ive called him since and he first said ""what are you on about"" and then hung up which is when I knew I got scammed and then I called the police and filed a report and Ive called o2 and barred the IMIE number but im sure there is some way around that.. and then I called him again and he actually answered and had the audacity to mock me and say stuff like ""first ive brought it and now ive stolen it"" and ""I saw you had a knife on your wall so you cant call the police anyway"" even though that is perfectly legal here (UK) and stuff like that, just basically completely mocking me and laughing at me. And I said its going to be barred and worthless and the police will be looking for you so please just return it but he just laughed and didnt really respond and kept mocking me and then hung up, and then he even texted me after saying ""who do you worship"", and i replied ""please give me back my phone"" and he said ""but who do you worship"".. so hes clearly just taking the piss out of me.

Honestly I am so so devestated. I really needed that money beyond belief and not just that but it was a gift from my partner and she also is so devestated by it and im so screwed now. She didnt take out insurance because the contract was so expensive by itself so its just completely lost and Ive got nothing for it and every single month now me and my partner will see this bill coming out of our account for the next 2 years reminding me about when I got scammed at the worst time possible and how stupid I was. 

I have their phone number, but I imagine its a burner phone or something. Is there anything that can be done besides the police avenue? I really only got his phone number and the description of them is 2 white men average size which could be almost anybody in england so I feel like the police literally wont be able to do anything at all and even speaking to them is  just wasting more of my life to the situation.

If anything let this be a warning to you. Ive watched countless episodes of scammer payback and browning and kitboga and ive seen all of these scams and I still let them leave without me actually getting the money. I definately thought they couldve made a fake app after everything ive watched but I really didnt expect this 3rd person woman that they must have someone arranged to recieve the details he had put in his fake bank transfer striaght away and be ready to lie for him on the phone. I really didnt expect that and I didnt know what else I could do when they had proven both those things to me. 

I shouldve called the bank from my phone, thats the only thing I can think of.. But then I could be in a very different situation where Id be stabbed or hurt because they wanted to steal it so badly.

What would you have done? and Is there anyway perogi or jim browning could actively track an EE phone number or something along that lines so I could find out who they actually are and get them arrested? Or am I dreaming there?

Thanks everyone",
ScammerPayback,I know a locksmith scammer!!,12pv6qh,GrapefruitNo2769,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScammerPayback/comments/12pv6qh/i_know_a_locksmith_scammer/,Hey I’m just curious if anybody in here has ever ran into locksmiths who over charge and aren’t licensed. I just recently worked for one who had me running around doing lockouts and rekeying while I was learning. Pretty much they don’t teach yah anything send yah out with tools and I would learn as I did the job. I later found out your supposed to have a license for locksmithing. I’m sure these guys don’t. Anywho they had me collect all the money from customers and use venmo/Jobox/PayPal/cash app and zelle for this. Then I would send them all the money to their accounts after taking my 25%. I’m curious as to why they do it like this? Does anyone know if I would have to pay taxes on all that money or not? Any ideas on how to scam these scammers??,

(I now know this was a hacked account) I reached out to her on Facebook dicussed an item and sent money via PayPal to her friend (because she only had cash app and zelle) with the friends and family feature. I pulled the trigger too fast and may not be able to recover my $600. 
After not hearing back about completing the purchase I got suspicious and did more checking. I found this was a second bogus account and that my friend was not selling anything. In fact she said someone had hacked this account two years ago and has been using it to scam people ever since. Another friend of hers lost $3,000. The hacker is holding the page hostage and will sell it back to her for $5,000. Because we trusted this person we use the friends and family feature of PayPal that does not have purchase protection. 
She has reported this to Facebook and they have done nothing to take down the page. If I had the skills, I would destroy this person but I don't. Do you?",

Like an idiot I fell for it and lost $600. I later went to a few r/CashApp subreddits and posted my cashtag to see if anyone was kind enough to send at least $1. Little did I knew that I just made the biggest mistake of my life. One guy texted me and sent in a $1900 check and other guy texted me claiming her sister was with the F.B.I. started believing everything the F.B.I. guy was saying to the point where I sent my SSN because I thought it was for the case to prove I'm real. The $1900 check guy was in a money laundering scheme so I sent the $1900 to the F.B.I. agent. Comes to find out a few days later that the check was fake and my account was in -$1900. The F.B.I. was a fake the entire time and now I'm in crippling dept. It's gone to the point where my best friend made a GoFundMe (which I'm not posting here to respect the rules of this subreddit) and my family is pulling hairs to fix all of this.

I've not lost any money via this interaction but it just seems very suspicious so figured I would post it here and see if anyone else knew if it was a scam.  
Anyway, I matched with a profile on a dating app.  Picture of a woman, verified profile,   seemignly above board.  
The profile said in the bio that they don't like being called a catfish and started messaging me pushing very hard to exchange numbers and video call on Whatsapp.  
    
I gave them the number of a burner phone and we started messaging.  Some chatting at first with some broken English from the potential scammer that they explained with their being French and English not being their first language.  
I did video call with them breifly (covered my camera) but from what I could tell, the woman in the video chat was the same woman as the dating app profile.  Video quality was low however and my guess is that it was possible pre-recorded.  


The next day, this was the exchange:

19/09/2023, 14:55 - <Redditor>: We can move forward. You keep going through the process and send me screenshots of what you're doing and I'll do it on my phone  
19/09/2023, 14:55 - <Redditor>: Easy  
19/09/2023, 14:55 - <Redditor>: I am here atm  
19/09/2023, 14:56 - <Scammer>: I don't have time to teach you because you can't provide me with screenshots  
19/09/2023, 14:56 - <Redditor>: It's easy just send screenshots what you're doing and I'll follow along  
19/09/2023, 14:56 - <Redditor>: Takes the same amount of time  
19/09/2023, 14:57 - <Scammer>: We can continue when you give me screenshots. I don't want to teach you right now.  
19/09/2023, 14:58 - <Redditor>: Ok when you're ready to do the next step in the process send me a screenshot of what to do and I'll follow along  
19/09/2023, 14:58 - <Redditor>: I can wait  
After this point we're in a circle where they refuse to keep going without screenshots and I continue to explain I'll follow along to their screenshots instead.  


The quickness and pushiness of the exchanging phone numbers, sketchy video chat, and unrelenting requests for screenshots of my Trustwallet were a bit sus imo.

CryptoScams,WhatsApp group  crypto Scam,1cyxed2,Wide-Ad2366,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoScams/comments/1cyxed2/whatsapp_group_crypto_scam/,"Something crazy just happened, let me just tell you the backstory first.

My aunt was unexpectedly added to a WhatsApp group on an app called MK-Z2. This group was managed by someone named Professor Mark and his assistant Jonnae. They claimed to offer crypto trading signals.

In the group, they persuaded my aunt to download their CATY co app and also advised her to download a crypto app like Gemini. Following their instructions, my aunt deposited $6000, purchased digital currency from the crypto app, and transferred it to the CATY co app.

Initially, my aunt deposited $6000 into the scammer's account. We tried to withdraw the money but we could only withdraw around $1000. The CATy Co account scammer's wallet placed a withdrawal restriction on the account, and only after the 18th of May, we could withdraw money from CATy Co. So, we planned to at least wait until the 18th of May and see what happens. However, before the 18th of May, while my aunt was in the middle of the trade, I pressed close on the trade and we lost all the remaining money that was on the account which was (5000 dollars my aunt's deposit and $4000 profit ). I think the profit that my aunty made trading in scammer wallets is fake because when I check the scammer wallet address on the block explore it shows a balance of zero. Here is the crazy part, my aunt again deposited around $800 (0.2898307 ETH) into the CATY co-account a couple of days ago, and she started trading for a couple of days in CATY co the account. It showed that she made a profit from 0.2898307 ETH to 0.34089 ETH by trading in a scammer app (CATy co account), I even checked the block explore, and at first, it showed my aunt's initial balance of ETH (0.2898307) in block explorer but during the second day it showed balance of 0. So we just tried withdrawing all the money from the CATY co-account and transferring it to Genimi. When the withdrawal was complete my Aunt Genimi's balance was now 0.34089 ETH, before it was 0.2898307 ETH.

I am sure it’s a scam but are they doing this to gain our trust so we could deposit more money?",

For anyone who is experiencing this, the exchange is CEX,  https://h5.cexsg.net

This morning, I read that many people couldn't transfer their BTC/ETH/USDT out of their Coinbase Wallet so, I panicked and initiated a transfer. My funds were originally transferred from Coinbase to Coinbase Wallet in the beginning of the romantic scam. Not knowing it was a scam... 

Lo and behold, my account is now frozen and I'm completely locked out. No one or nowhere to turn to. 

If anyone had success recovering their crypto, please let me know the methods and how to report this to the authorities (and who).

Lots of bots pretending to be other members in the groups, constantly posting about their ‘gains’ and ‘earnings’. I report those groups as scams to WhatsApp several times per day and nothings happens. Must be some others reporting them as well.

She told me both her and her dad worked as crypto analyst and earned a living doing this. We talked everyday for weeks. She told me I should start crypto investing she would guide and teach me how to. I accepted and opened an account on bitopro-us.com the exchange she suggested. Over several months I would add hundreds of dollars each week when I got paid (transfers from cash app to bitopro). My total invested was $1,800.  She would tell me when to place trades. My bitopro account grew to over $4,500 and I want to withdraw some now. This is when I realized it was a scam the exchange would not let me withdraw. They even said I had to pay taxes before I could withdraw money. When I asked her she said this normal. I did some online research on bitopro exchange and many people call it a scam. She stopped messaging me back after I told her I could not withdraw money. I'm heart broken and sad I liked this girl but we never meet.

So these are the steps he did to scam me:

\- We met through the app Blued (yes I am gay)

\- He is supposedly Malaysian living in Osaka (doubtful)

\- He asked me to meet him there on the 20th 

\- He's supposedly wealthy blah blah and he told me he could teach me how to make money

\- First he made me create an account and this could be important: a bitFlyer account (A legit one)

\- I transferred my 0.075 ETH from my dmm bitcoin account to bitFlyer (They took 0.005 as a fee)

\- He said the bitFlyer account was needed because it takes too long to send from DMM to his broker (DMM took a day and half but dmm costs 0 to transfer either to bank or to other crypto addresses)

\- Then after this first transfer was completed and since it was a legit app and site I kinda lost and registered to his supposed broker: Decode Gobal

\- Googled it and it kinda matched except this site was a phishing scam I just didn't notice it at first.

\- I transfered 0.07 from bitFlyer to this fake broker

\- The site I can post if allowed but it's a phishing site.

\- He was very pushy and wants me to download and this is also very important: MT5 or metatrader 5

\- He wanted me mostly to do it on my phone which did sound weird

\- The MT5 app is loaded from a Chinese site, I found out Apple suspended MT5 because it was being used by scammers.

&#x200B;

Currently I kinda am on talks but I didn't answer him since yesterday, he wants badly to teach me how to make money but I looked it after I transferred and the MT5 scam happened to some other guy,

So yeah if allowed I would post more details and even my fake account so you can check it yourself because well it has money that in theory isn't retrievable.

&#x200B;

As for the reasons why I think it is obvious but its a site that has a weird typo and sometimes is ""on maintenance"" as he said, and because the legit site is similar to it.

I also checked the crypto address and it already had some ETH but not too much.

CryptoScams,UK WhatsApp scams,1alfjcg,commonorgarden,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoScams/comments/1alfjcg/uk_whatsapp_scams/,"I’ve been added to a number of groups, but this is a pattern which I thought hasn’t been well documented. I am adding this here hoping that if someone is interested in this, they’ll maybe find this post. Maybe you have to a relative who needs persuading. (Context: I’m a financial journalist and despise these con artists.)

Let me say, first: real financial advice will never come via a random WhatsApp group. No kosher businessman offers financial advice through an open WhatsApp channel.

 If that’s not enough proof, here’s some more stuff. 

So:

- I was added to a “Gemini” group, which is focused on the UK. They set up a WhatsApp community with an announcement channel which they then use to spam you. They then advertise an open channel where, as I learned, if you ask hard questions you’re ejected. If you want to save a relative, try being modestly questioning in the WhatsApp channel and they’ll get banned.

Some steps on looking into these people. 

- the Gemini group said their company had a Companies House registration, and showed a certificate. To be clear, this proves nothing. No kosher businessman sends people companies house registrations as proof of anything. That is mental. 

- But in this case, the company number did not match their details. (If this happens to you, check by tapping the number in [here](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/). If the number does not come up or match their company name, RUN AWAY.).

- If it does match their company name, there is no guarantee the fraudsters are actually the owners! You can check the owners (Go to “People” then “persons with significant control”). Then Google them and talk to them on the phone  to check its really them. It won’t be.

- In my group, they then showed an FCA registration number - the Financial Conduct Authority. Again, have a look at the [regulator website](https://register.fca.org.uk/s/). Look them up there. And watch out for notes saying “this company name is used in scams”. This is the company number used in my scam: look at the note [here](https://register.fca.org.uk/s/firm?id=0014G00002WMeCnQAL). 

- in my case, the group claims to be led by ”Jeremy Anderson”, a real person at KPMG (obv, it’s not the real Jeremy Anderson). Again, I messaged the real one. He’s not come back yet, but I am willing to bet he’s not running a dodgy WhatsApp group on the side.

You will also see that the advice is absolutely dire. And in my case, he got confused and switched phone number halfway through. Check out this bollocks:

“Good decisions take time, they are the result of deep thought, not impulse. So the first point is to have better analytical skills. Regardless of how the market moves, whether the price fluctuations are small or large, we first need to see the general trend. Grasp the trend, so as not to invest haphazardly, in order to trade in a clear direction, and naturally improve the success rate of trading.”

Real trading advice says “we think x is undervalued because [actual concrete reasons]”. Push them: who is going to buy this thing in the future at a higher price and why?

Good luck all, and stay safe from these bastards.",

CryptoScams,WhatsApp Groupchat / OKX Globals — Scam?,1bxrtyb,Armistice__,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoScams/comments/1bxrtyb/whatsapp_groupchat_okx_globals_scam/,"Hey folks, 

I apologize for the lengthy post, but I feel inclined to provide as much detail and info as possible to see if others are having a similar or the same experience. 

&#x200B;

I was recently added to a group named ""ICE - Strategy Team-71"" and then subsequently ""ICE-Strategy-Team-22"". I have no idea how they found my WhatsApp info, but I reached out to the ""\~Customer Assistant-Emily"" who is in charge of heading the trading analyses, and she says that ""maybe \[some people\] have invested before, and some of them are randomly invited"".  

&#x200B;

She (her profile pic is a woman) claims to be a part of the ICE — a ""professional investment company established for 24 years, covering multiple investment fields such as stocks, funds, and cryptocurrencies"". She sent an ""official website link"" for people to view — https://www.ice.com/index. She says that the group I'm in is a promotion group and when I ""officially cooperate with us, \[she\] will invite \[me\] to join the official group"". The ""official/formal"" group, she says, that people can enjoy benefits like; guidance of trading strategies every day; from time to time, professional analysts will share their investment experience in formal groups; professional lectures on how to chart trend distribution; sharing latest news on cryptocurrency. 

&#x200B;

The first group that I was invited to, there were a few people who questioned her analysis and why she wants to help people make money. I thought, okay, it seems like there are other skeptics like me. However, others are posting buy/sell orders and trades of them making profits and praising Emily for her guidance. 

&#x200B;

I've tried to do some research of my own with the trading platform — [https://m.okxglobals.com](https://m.okxglobals.com) — which seemed pretty legit but there are some UX/UI design flaws (some letters/words are in title case and some are not, not to mention the ugly-looking home-page banner design). In any case, people have posted their registrations and subsequently seemingly trading with high returns based on Emily's guidance. Besides the screenshots of people making profits off Emily's guidance and orders, people are also posting somewhat-lavish-but-realistic lifestyle habits of them leveraging their newfound profits like a photo of an expensive dinner, stacks of benjamins (followed with the caption, ""I prepared a sum of cash and planned my vacation"", or sharing how they will be spending their profits. 

&#x200B;

They all seem like real people, and when I commented how I'm new to all this and a bit of background info about why I could really use this financial guidance, someone from the group reached out to me and asked if ""I was a newbie"". I started conversating with this person asking how it all works and whether this was all legitimate, and he seemed to provide pretty solid answers and elaborations. He explained that these are contract transactions and not real holdings so we earn the difference by buying/selling. He even explained that the OKXglobals platform that we use are dedicated to contract trading, which can't be performed on Coinbase. Also if our monthly profit reaches more than 30%, we have to pay them (Emily and admins) a 20% commission from our profits (but no fee if 30% hasn't been reached). 

&#x200B;

I told Emily that I was skeptical about all of it, and she empathized with me saying of course I would be seeing as this is my first time to all this. She asked how much capital I planned to start off with and if I had deposited funds yet after I registered an account on there and I said that maybe I'll deposit $500 to start off. She said that in order to trade BTC, I would need to deposit a minimum of $1k to conduct transactions. 

&#x200B;

With all that said, I have yet to deposit anything for fear of being scammed, but I've seen similar posts like this one with other different WhatsApp groups and now I'm getting red flags all over. 

&#x200B;

What do you guys think? Scam or no scam? Thanks for reading up to this point!

CryptoScams,Cobo 666 Tinder / WhatsApp Crypto Scam - I lost $60k,nl87we,cobo_666_scam,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoScams/comments/nl87we/cobo_666_tinder_whatsapp_crypto_scam_i_lost_60k/,"Hi Reddit. I'm telling my story in case it helps someone else not get into the same situation. I created a new account to protect my own identity. I feel embarrassed that this happened to me but I'm sharing this anyway because I didn't find anything on Google or reddit about this app and it's my way of calling it a day to the losses that I suffered.

I was on Tinder and matched with someone who talked to me for about a week and then asked if I had WhatsApp. I told him that I did and we started to talk there. He was always talking about how he studied crypto trends and made money off of that.

Over time he asked me if I wanted to invest alongside his trends so that I can also benefit from the profits. For reasons that I regret now, I did. He sent me a direct download to the app ""Cobo 666"" which I looked up on the app store and saw ""Cobo"" so I thought it was another version of it. He said it was for OTC crypto transactions while the other app was for regular crypto investing.

I decided to invest $25k in ETH which I transferred via wallet transfer from Coinbase. He then instructed me to convert that to USDT on the platform. We started our first investment session together, which through just 30 min of 5-6 shorts 300 second shorts on the platform showed that I had profited $5k.

The next day, he kept telling me how a day from now, there is a huge trend that will make a lot of money so I should add more money in. I brought over about $55k of ETH in the same way and had a total of $88k or so in the app at this point (including the ""profits"" I earned from before).

The next day came and I made sure that I had time to invest during the time that he told me there would be the trend. After the investment session, the $88k turned into $107k.

That night, I was contemplating this whole situation more fully because I was really busy with work lately and not really thinking everything through. I started to look on Google and found websites warning of similar situations that I was in, and realized I was probably part of a scam or fraud situation. He never really shared that much about his personal life and when I asked him specific questions about his personal life he would ignore them.

Without letting him know, I started to attempt to withdraw from my Cobo 666 account. I tried $20k at first and the transaction was not immediate. I messaged their ""customer service"" (you can see the link on the bottom of their website) and they looked into it, and eventually it came through, but oddly instead of ETH which I started the transaction in, it was USDT that arrived in my Coinbase. I was like WHEW.

Now to the bad part. I then tried to withdraw all the rest money out of the Cobo 666 wallet and it did not go through after an hour or so, so I contacted customer service. They then went on to say that I needed to pay $35k in income tax. I asked them why and they told me that it's because I deposited $82k in, profited $36k so they took 30% of that total and got to $35k (?) - all in broken english (Chinese-based website). I asked if they can just deduct the $35k ""income tax"" from the entire account balance and give me the difference back and they said no, they need to receive the money separately.

They froze my account ""for security"" and told me that if I don't pay the $35k in income tax then they would deduct 5% from my account until it is depleted. In the meantime, the guy I was talking to on WhatsApp was basically egging me on to pay the income tax and not lose the 5%.

I'm just accepting the loss and definitely not going to give that app anymore money. I just hope they can get shut down and no one else ends up in this disillusioned situation. Thanks for reading.",

CryptoScams,Bit-Hivex WhatsApp group scam and Report,15ymong,culher72,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoScams/comments/15ymong/bithivex_whatsapp_group_scam_and_report/,"Hi Everyone 👋🏻
  
I hope I am at the right place and that this post will reach you with full spirit! 

Long story short, I was targeted by a crypto scam. I was randomly invited to a WhatsApp group and the scammers seemed very trustworthy, full of knowledge about cryptocurrency and said they would help us get rich by following a trade signal everyday on low coins that we could find on a specific app they recommended (Bit-hivex). 

For the record if you have ever been recommended that app or been in WhatsApp groups with Admins by the name of Amine, Rudolf, Joseph or Bonnie, please RUN AWAY! Other people like me have lost money with those crooks, Trustpilot will tell you too!

They were actually controlling the app and made the funds suddenly disappear by pretending there’s been an error. We were advised to put more money to recover what’s been lost and so on. 

In total, I have lost £16k before realising I was being seriously scammed. Of that £16K, I still have £5K stuck on the app where I cannot withdraw and that the scammers have kept these frozen. 

Because I’m based in the Uk, I have warned Action Fraud, The FCA, Citizen advice, trading Standards, I have also put a review of the app everywhere I could; and reported every dodgy crypto ads on my Facebook and Instagram feeds (well done Meta lol).

Would be nice if law enforcement could investigate and arrest those people, but from the last update I got from Action Fraud, they don't seem motivated to do a thing because they haven't find any other scam report matching mine so far. 

My question might seem dumb, but I have seen reddit bot sharing multiple good link to report a fraud including the FBI cyber security (IC3). 
I want to report them as much as I can but the fact I am based in the UK is there any point to report it to the FBI ? 
Is Cyber Crime International for them, would they investigate this ? 

Their address on scamadviser is reported in the US so I thought they could be a link for them to  look into it ?

I also contacted legit solicitors that could potentially help recover part of my funds. 
These solicitors, are unfortunately not as responsive as I would like even though I know the process will take some time. 

Let's see where this go 🤷🏻‍♂️
Even though its a very stressful, painful and hard to accept situation I kind of made my peace with my loss by now.

CryptoScams,Fake Job Scam - from Text to WhatsApp,19eht82,PhilM44,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoScams/comments/19eht82/fake_job_scam_from_text_to_whatsapp/,"After receiving a nice text from ""Victoria"" (from ""SGF Global"" / number 786-408-XXXX) on Monday this week, regarding remote part time work-from-home jobs, I was directed straight to WhatsApp to wait for the hiring person to contact me.  On Tuesday, ""Ella"" (from ""Page Zero Media"" / number 579-485-XXXX) contacted me through WhatsApp with their proposal:

&#x200B;

\[2:39 PM, 1/23/2024\] +1 (579) 485-XXXX: Our company’s name is Page Zero Media. It's a multinational company and our Headquarter is in Canada It has been registered in Canada for almost 20 years. The primary role is to assist merchants in improving their product data values through rating, thereby increasing product exposure, reviews, and ratings ultimately enhancing the product's visibility and ratings on online shopping platforms like Amazon, Walmart, Costco, eBay, and Shopify.

\[2:39 PM, 1/23/2024\] +1 (579) 485-XXXX: In this role, you'll work for about 45 minutes to an hour each day, earning daily commissions. You role is simple just click on the products that are displayed on the company platform and submit then for the ratings and reviews within the platform. The platform handles data integration through it's algorithm and your role is to click and submit product data.

\[2:39 PM, 1/23/2024\] +1 (579) 485-XXXX: Before we continue with the salary specifics, do you understand or do you have any questions?

\[2:43 PM, 1/23/2024\] Me: Not yet, go on

\[2:44 PM, 1/23/2024\] +1 (579) 485-XXXX: Here is the Pay:You work for two days you get paid👉\[ 100-500USD\]You work for five days you get paid👉\[ 400-1500 USD\]You work for ten days you get paid👉\[1000-3000 USD\] and so on.Earnings can surpass these averages depending on your dedication to the job.

\[2:45 PM, 1/23/2024\] +1 (579) 485-XXXX: There is a concise training conducted on WhatsApp, featuring instructive images and explanations, and it typically takes 25-30 minutes to complete. This training is provided at no cost. Furthermore, once you finish the training, you'll receive a training commission of approximately 50-65, ensuring that your time investment is rewarded. Are you ready?

&#x200B;

I held off on the ""training"" since this was sounding quite fishy.  The ranges of pay are quite wide, and ""Ella"" had no real explanation on why, other than ""dedication to the work.""  So, I contacted both of these real companies, and they both said that this is NOT how they work, so it is definitely the scam that was described in a post earlier this week here, just with a slight change.

What would be the best way to report this scam, in addition to here?  SGF Global is a worldwide recruiting company, and I'm emailing with their U.S. recruiter now.  Page Zero Media is in Toronto, and I told them, but have no idea how to report to the RCMP.  Does anyone know what steps I might take?  Thanks.",
CryptoScams,Beware of Scam Apps! Lost $644 to a Fraudulent Poocoin App on the App Store,14z450p,Sharpsky7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoScams/comments/14z450p/beware_of_scam_apps_lost_644_to_a_fraudulent/,"Hey fellow crypto enthusiasts,

I’m writing this post today to share a harrowing experience I recently had with a fraudulent app on the Apple App Store and hopefully prevent others from falling into the same trap.

I came across what was seemingly the official app of Poocoin, a popular cryptocurrency service. After installing the app, I was asked to input my mnemonic phrase - the private key to my crypto wallet. Trusting the stringent security measures and vetting processes of the App Store, I went ahead and entered my details.

However, my efforts to use the app were unsuccessful, which led me to look more closely into it. I found several red flags: there were no user reviews, and the app had only been available on the App Store for a short period - roughly a month.

The real shock came when I checked my crypto wallet. My funds had been transferred to an unfamiliar wallet without my consent. In total, I lost around Php 35,000 or approximately USD 644. This isn’t just a financial loss; it’s a breach of trust.

This experience has been a stark reminder that scams can infiltrate even the most seemingly secure platforms. I’m sharing this with you all as a cautionary tale. Always double-check the legitimacy of the apps you download, no matter where they’re from. Don’t let your hard-earned savings become an easy target for these scammers.

Stay safe and let’s look out for one another in this volatile crypto landscape.

Peace,
John",

CryptoScams,"SCAM, FRAUD, HONEY POT: My Experience with NCWallet (app.ncwallet.net) - A Cautionary Tale",1brn307,Gr8Bud,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoScams/comments/1brn307/scam_fraud_honey_pot_my_experience_with_ncwallet/,"I'm sharing my experience with NCWallet (app.ncwallet.net) not for your sympathy or sarcasm, but as a stark WARNING about the practices I've encountered, which bear all the hallmarks of a sophisticated SCAM. My journey with NCWallet began smoothly, with initial transactions ranging from $10 to $100 processed without issue, a strategy that now appears designed to build trust. However, the façade quickly crumbled when I attempted to engage with more significant amounts.  
  
After increasing my deposits, my account was locked on March 4, with all attempts to resolve the situation through their KYC process met with almost complete silence. Despite providing all requested documents promptly and reaching out via multiple tickets, I have received no acknowledgment or assistance, just a request for patience. It's been 4 weeks of waiting, with no access to my funds and no responses to my repeated inquiries.  
  
This pattern of behavior—enticing users with small, successful transactions before locking them out after more substantial deposits—strikes me as a classic ""honey pot"" scheme, designed to lure and trap unsuspecting users. It's a clear and present WARNING to anyone considering NCWallet for storage or trading: STAY AWAY!  
  
To those who've encountered similar issues, I encourage you to raise your voice and contact the relevant authorities. It's important to expose these practices for what they are and to protect others from falling into similar traps. My account remains inaccessible, and the silence from NCWallet speaks volumes about their scamming operations. Let this be a warning to all: stay away from NCWallet and safeguard your investments elsewhere.  
  
PS: NCwallet will probably close my account now and delete my tickets, STEALING my crypto, to provide further confirmation that this is a SCAM.  
I am willing to change my review if anything changes, but I have no confidence in their services and intentions!",

It gives you the opportunity to trade (long or short) on 30s - 60s - 90s or 120s each option gives you a return on investment 20% - 30% - 50% - 70% respectively.

Example: Long 30s if you bid 100 USDT you get +20$ if the price went up as you predicted. If you are wrong and the price goes down you lose your 100 usdt.

I'm personally not an experienced trader and would probably lose all my money on this app if I was trading alone. Luckily for me I have a ""friend"" (online acquaintance) who helped me out get some trades in and making up to 17 000 usdt on one evening, insane right! This is the same person who introduced me to this app...

Then came the time to withdraw my funds and I was told I need to pay income tax of 10% for a total nearing 3000 USDT and the way to pay this tax is by depositing more money into your account.

Im not bragging, I just want people to know that Im very cautious when it comes to crypto (I don’t have active wallets on my phone, etc)  And I know my funds cannot be recovered. Im not asking for any donations for my blunder. And, Im aware of just how many people are scammed on the daily, and for much more than what I lost. So Im well aware that happened to me is not unique, for the most part, and has happened to many others. But, I truly  just want to share my experience of how I I was scammed out of $130k.

 It was an elaborate and clever scam, which took place over the course of 2 weeks.  Scammers involved are a group individuals unknown to me, and it’s called a “Pig Butcher” scam.                                                               

A  random asian woman messaged me on the Nextdoor app on 5/21/2024,  after she commented on the one and ONLY post I made on Nextdoor regarding what a great job a person I hired had done to clean my backyard. I didn’t reply to her initial messages, because I was already thinking, this woman is a scammer. But scammer was persistent. Eventually, out of curiosity, I replied, and our initial conversations started on the Nextdoor chat app. Upon my initial reply I thought to myself, “what could she do to me anyway?”  

The scammer then cajoled me into downloading and switching our communication via WhatsApp starting 5/30/2024 – 6/18/2024. I don’t talk about crypto to ANYONE. I don’t have any social media public profile, except for the NextDoor app which I created on 5/18/2024 and the account only contains my first name. Im not on any dating apps, facebook… nothing.  Except for my Twitter anon account\*\*\*.  I did not mention anything about crypto during our first 3 days of our conversation.  The topic casually came up while we were debating about the world financial system.\*\*\*

 I enjoyed the friendly conversations with this scammer, purely because she claimed she was from Japan, spoke Japanese, and moved to NYC from Japan 4 years ago, then moved to Austin 7 months ago. At that point, they were details in which we shared in common. I visited my now ex-wife multiple times while she was living in Japan, I speak a little Japanese, and I lived in NYC for a few years in my 20’s. **THERE IS NO WAY IN HELL, THAT THIS WOMAN COULD HAVE KNOWN THESE DETAILS ME BEFOREHAND. I ONLY JOINED NEXTDOOR APP ON 5/18/2024 TO LOOK FOR YARD CLEANING SERVICES AND ONLY POSTED ONE TIME**.

And just to to be clear, I wasn’t looking for any romantic entanglement upon/during our conversations. I lost my younger brother and mother a few years ago, and I went through a long period of self induced isolation. So I think that fact also played a factor in why I continued to talk with the scammer. I was also focused on “making it,” this cycle, and my thoughts were that this cycle is my last chance to make it before all the regulatory mandates on crypto go into effect.

**\~What I lost from this scam:\~**  
Most of the money scammed from me was in form of crypto currency. The rest of the money was $6,000 cash from my checking account and $15,000 from one credit card. By the end of the scam, I had lost approximately $130,000.  Also, My identity was compromised via uploading my US Passport on the scam exchange platform. Scammer has my US Passport information, name of my employer, and my occupation.

 **\~Precautionary measures I have done after the scam:\~**

-       Reported this event to FBI 

-       Reported stolen US Passport 

-       Filed a police report of the incident.

**\~Details of the scam are as follows:\~**

-       I was lured into registering an account on a scam crypto exchange 

-       Scammer claimed that her uncle was Li Lu (retired CEO of the hedge fund company Himalaya Capital.

-       Scammer then explained that her “uncle” has a data analyst team predicting the outcome of BTC/USDT pair price on certain days of the week. On those days, we would trade BTC/USDT pair via Contract Delivery trading.

-       I then deposited USDT and ETH on the platform. Scammer claimed that data analyst team notifies her 2 hours before commencement of Delivery Contract trading, thus relaying the message to me.

-       After the first day of trading, I made a sizable profit.  My first deposit was approximately $40k and I was able to withdraw all profits after the first day of trading, $20k. I was then convinced by scammer to deposit a larger sum to the exchange in order to increase my profits. I participated in 4 days of trading.  Each day of trading consisted of 3 rounds, with each round lasting between 60 seconds to 120 seconds.

-       However, I was unable to withdraw my funds from the exchange after the second day of trading. The exchange’s customer service representative (who was quick to reply) via chat line said that inability to withdraw funds was due to security lock on my account, which would be lifted in 24 hours. But the scammer fostered enough trust from me to keep adding funds to the platform.

After 4 days of trading, again I was unable to withdraw my funds due to “system error.” Per exchange’s customer service rep via chat, they were unable to resolve the problem and I would have to contact their “manual” customer service on WhatsApp for a resolution. **AT THIS POINT I ALREADY KNEW I TRULY FUCKED.**

-       I contacted the exchange’s Whatsapp “manual” customer service representative and was told that I would have to pay the exchange 20% from profits incurred from trading on the platform before I would be able to withdraw my funds. Tax accrual amounted to $42,857, and I was not allowed to deduct the “tax” from my funds within the exchange. “Tax” amount would have to be paid through funds outside of the platform.

Scammer than proposed she would pay $17,000 from her own funds outside of the exchange, (which she did, confirmed via transaction hash on Etherscan) so that I would only need to pay $25,857.  I did NOT plan on paying the “tax,” but I pretended that I would need some time to procure the $25,857, in order to keep the scammer conversation going on WhatsApp. I, at least, was able to get the scammer to reveal that that she was in possession US passport info and what she intended to do with it, and confirming her connection with the exchange platform. Scammer said, she would use my identity to scam others, in turn implicating me to future crimes she intends to commit. I have transcripts and screenshots of my WhatApp interaction with scammer and exchange platform. For my own protection, ie damage control.

When I first posted on Twitter that I was scammed and asked for help in pointing me towards the right direction to report this scam exchange, I was bombarded with accounts claiming they would able to retrieve my funds (another form of scam).  But I would have to pay upfront fees to start their “investigation.”  If you are like me, DON’T DO IT.  Funds are next to impossible to retrieve.

 **\~Scammer’s information:\~**

Scammers will introduce you some high yield returns projects or plans. They used dating apps and will solicit you to invest money on it. Your money won't be back! If you're hacked, don't pay anymore money for KYC. If someone said they can help to recover your money, don't trust them as well.

I’m trying to figure out how all of these people are falling for scams/how they are initially contacted because it is like pulling teeth to get them to say what happened. 

I’ve seen a lot of people (older especially) get sucked into these crypto scams, and I know that a lot of them probably don’t have WhatsApp just hanging out on their phone until someone instructs them to download it. But it looks like the two main sources are random WhatsApp messages, and online dating?

Need help with next steps.",1c088ed,RevolutionaryPlane29,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoScams/comments/1c088ed/345000_scammed_need_help_with_next_steps/,"I have a family friend of mine who’s a senior citizen and has been scammed out of every penny he had to his name by a bitcoin pig butchering scam.

It started on Silver Singles dating app. He was contacted by a lady who appeared to be 45 and attractive. They talked over text message for about 4-5 months. She claimed to be a successful finance analyst at a bank in San Francisco California. Long story short, they built a relationship and he was completely fooled, thinking she was a real connection. She convinced him that she was successful trading bitcoin and they would talk regularly almost everyday over text, occasional voice notes and even once or twice over FaceTime (she was actually attractive and was the same woman from the photos shared). She walked him through the process of investing in bitcoin at the dips and used some user interface to show the profitable returns on investments, that he was obviously very happy believing. It started small with a $1000 investment, then turned into multiple $25k, $50k and even a $100k investment into bitcoin using the app “STRIKE” which appears to be a legitimate app.

When he would be convinced to make these investments on STRIKE, the next step would be to transfer the bitcoin to a site called “Trust Wallet”, which also appears to be a legit app. The interesting thing about “Trust Wallet” is that it has its own web browser in the app. After all of this was said and done I tried to have him walk me through the steps but this is where I was a bit confused. My assumption is that this scammer had a website created with a unique but similar URL, and perhaps a similar UX, and had it linked or listed in this trust wallet “browser” somehow. 

By the time he asked me for help this site and all of the history and transactions were gone. 

He has created a case with FBI cyber crime, but I am really interested to learn what other steps can be taken. While hope of recovering any of the money is low, there is also a concern of all the taxes the IRS will want because he decided to pull a lot out of his retirement.

Hopeful someone can share any experience or recommend next steps for my friend who lost everything. Thanks in advance.",
CryptoScams,Scam or a married woman trying to keep her identity secret?,1b7hwia,Hanman9999,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoScams/comments/1b7hwia/scam_or_a_married_woman_trying_to_keep_her/,"Hi  
I met this hot-looking accented girl on Bumble. She claims to be Russian/American with businesses in Boston and Miami (Spas). I asked to meet and she always had an excuse. Traveling etc.  
As we texted each other on a daily basis the subject became investments and she told me that she invests in Crypto options on Crypto.com . I told her that I got burnt on Crypto and my investments in the last 3 years were down 95%. She said she would help me consolidate and invest the rest of the money ( which amounted to $900) by trading options. I was feeling adventurous so I went along. She helped me set up my Crypto DefiWallet and we started trading together telling me exactly what to do I would send her screenshots of my phone every step of the way so she could check before I put in the orders.  
We've made 16 trades all were successful except one (she even told me that she wasn't 100% sure about that particular trade). She said her aunt had a team of researchers that told her when to trade with minimum risk, which so far has turned out to be true. I'm tempted to invest more but I'm still very suspicious. I continued to ask her to meet and it was always something or another. So I asked to talk to her via WhatsApp video. We talked twice. She looked exactly like her pictures on Bumble and the ones she sent me on WhatsApp.  
I decided to take 2 of her pictures and ran them on Google search. I found out that those pictures were of a known personality with 700K followers who was married to a DJ and living in Argentina.!!!!  
Can anyone share their experience in the Crypto/ Bumble dating world to help me decide to confront her after I pull my $6000 out ACTLY like this woman! I have not confronted her yet out of fear that because helped set up my Crypto DefiWallet. My question is: Can she have a back door to my account without me knowing? if she walked me through the process of setting up the wallet? If it is a scam can she withdraw my funds without my participation? I'm up $1500 in less than 2 weeks. She encouraged me to sell all my stock portfolio ($30,000) and trade with her so we can double it in the next 2 months. She sent me a screenshot of her wallet and past trades. She had accumulated $700K. $80K of which was within the time we started trading together. Is this a scam or is she just hiding her identity and having fun without telling me who she is? IOW am I an idiot and not seeing this for what it is?  
The interesting thing is, when I video chatted with her there was a long delay with the voice not synching with the image. It was like she was overseas somewhere. Could be Argentina or who knows where?  
Can anyone share their experience in the Crypto/ Bumble dating world to help me decide to either confront her after I pull my $6000 out or continue this odd relationship?

I am posting here with the hope that it helps someone else avoid such scams.
The scammers lure you through WhatsApp or Telegram groups with stock tips. Most of the tips generate modest returns which make you trust their investment tips. Then they will create another group for crypto trading. This group will have a lot of fake members who will post their screenshots with massive profits. The administration, or so called 'professor' will have a bunch of 'associates' who will try to coax you into joining them in crypto trading.
Once you show any interest, they will guide to a scam website and make you trade a fake crypto token. You will never be able to withdraw your funds from this fake trading platform.
If you question them, they will just stop responding. 
I learnt all this the hard way and still feel terrible. My life has been miserable for past few months. I just hope this post helps at least one individual avoid the catastrophic consequences. ",

Started funding more money and making bigger trades all was good. Through out the whole time she was really pushy on me continuing to find the account.  She is who she claimed, I wasn’t sending funds directly to her so I continued to fund caincap.market account.  She even went as far as sending $15k into the account to keep the scam going.  When she really started pushing me to VIP 4 which required $115k worth of deposits.  I questioned it tried to make a large withdrawl which was blocked.  They come up with excuses that you need to send more money in I order to make withdrawals like “tax invoice”. I am still trying to figure out how to get my money and will be filing any and every type of complaint to all agencies including looking at criminal and civil suits against Amberly Yang.  I still can’t figure out how she is getting paid by coincap.market?  Do they recruit people to find victims to invest money like a pyramid scheme?

CryptoScams,Trying to find the scam,175bv6d,russkull1588,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoScams/comments/175bv6d/trying_to_find_the_scam/,"I connected with a woman via Tinder.  She allegedly is from Singapore and living in NYC.  Says she owns a nail salon.  We chatted a little via Tinder and then moved to WhatsApp.  First red flag.  We continued to chat back and fourth a couple of times a day  for a few weeks.  At some point she mentioned that she enjoyed investing.  Second red flag.  We talked about basic investing for a bit then she told me she was trading Bitcoin up/down contracts.  I knew very little of this at the time.  Over the next week or so she taught me how she was trading and showed me some transaction records and the returns were impressive.  

As a few more weeks went by I set up my own crypto.com account and a DeFi wallet.  I transferred a small amount of Bitcoin that I was holding.  She coached me for a few trades and they were profitable.  I added funds to my wallet and we continued to trade and I have learned some of her analysis techniques.  My returns are quite impressive.  I’ve doubled my balance to well over $100k.   

Now she has been trying to convince me to really up my funding. And giving urgency by saying the trends won’t last and trading opportunities are waining. Third red flag.  

My question is how would the scam work in this situation?   I have my own legitimate account and DeFi wallet.  I use a VPN and virus scan my phone.  If this is a scam how would they steal my wallet contents?   The entire time I’ve been doing this I have been wracking my brain trying to find the scam.  I’ve done a limited amount of scam baiting and like to think I’m rather savvy when it comes to spotting a scam.  And enjoy messing with them.

Thanks all for your education here. This has been a great resource and sounding board.

My husband has been scammed out of $350k so far. He is seriously considering paying another $500k to repay a ""loan"" he has. He won't listen to me that it is a scam. 

He claims his Trust wallet has $2.2m in it from his trading earnings but that it is now locked until he pays the loan. Do these scam dApps have the ability to lock his account that way? He hasn't shown me the wallet to prove it. But i haven't come across any scam examples where the person scammed actually had money put into their wallet this way.  I thought the fake balances always resided on the fake app/website.

I want to share my experience with a crypto scam I recently fell victim to, in the hopes of warning others about these predatory tactics. 

A random woman contacted me on WhatsApp and worked to gain my trust over time. This is known as the ""pig butchering"" technique, where scammers fatten up their targets before striking.

She convinced me to join a node on Trust Wallet *https://liuqnj.top*  and I would make about 1,8% to 2% daily. I started with a small amount before I deposited about 7,000 USDT. I got selected for this mining reward and I needed to deposit another 10,000 USDT to get 15 ETH reward. She assisted me with about 7,000 USDT and I was a bit desperate and I looked for 3,000 USDT. 
make an initial deposit of around $7,000 USDT. 

However, the funds were never released, and I was then asked to deposit another 10% of the total amount to get ""verified"" by the pool. The scammer even offered to contribute $6,000, asking me to add $1,000 but I was already scammed and in debt at this point in time. I never wanted to hear anything about it, up to date she's still insists on finishing this verification.

At this point, it's clear I've been taken advantage of and lost a significant sum of money. I'm sharing this experience to help others recognize the red flags of this ""pig butchering"" crypto scam. Please be extremely cautious of unsolicited contact, excessive promises of returns, and requests for additional funds. Losing money is painful, but raising awareness can prevent others from suffering the same fate.",

CryptoScams,Crypto scam with Authy,1c17sua,Wooden_Seesaw_9207,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoScams/comments/1c17sua/crypto_scam_with_authy/,"I have been approched by a guy saying that he had a lot of bitcoin on his Authy app. 

I directly called it a Scam. 
This guy was not believing me. 

Authy being and app that generates tokens for 2FA. It has nothing to do with crypto! 

He wanted my help to transfer crypto from from Authy to Binance. Of course this was impossible. 

I never heard about such a scam. 
My thought is that the scam works as follow:  
- Scammer requests to buyer to send a few K USD
- when USD received, scammer gives a list of QR codes that you can scan with your Authy app
- this will generate a lot of tokens of 2FA
- scammer claims that those tokens are crypto. Playing with the word “Token”. Token for a 2FA and for crypto are totally different. 

- buyer has been scammed. GAME OVER. 

Did someone has ever heard about such a Scam? 
I’m just suggesting that this scam works as explained, but I don’t know because the guy didn’t want to explain to me the whole history.

My friend has been telling me about a woman he met on here on Reddit on one of those ""r4r"" subs. 

She is from China, divorced and now lives in Miami. He lives here in NYC. She owns her own business in Miami in the beauty industry. He showed me pics of her and she's very pretty. They've been speaking for a few days and he really likes her. I don't think they ever had a video call. She moved the convo to WhatsApp after a day or two. Her number checks out as a local Miami number. 

Anyway, she mentioned a few times she trades Crypto. When my friend told me this, I rolled my eyes. Today, he mentioned to me that she wanted him to download a ""Trust Wallet"" from the app store, which he did. Then she wanted him to send her a screenshot of the home screen so she could teach him how to trade Crypto.

My Spidey senses are tingling and I told him do not send her anything. This seems like a set-up for a scam. He hasn't invested any money yet (according to him) and I don't want to see him get drawn in. I told him from everything he told me (which is what I've typed here), it sounds like a scam.

CryptoScams,"0xboost, a scam crypto staking website. Please don't invest your money on it.",16lyl1u,ProtectYourMoney,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoScams/comments/16lyl1u/0xboost_a_scam_crypto_staking_website_please_dont/,"Update on 9/25/2023: they changed domain from [0xboost.finance](https://0xboost.finance) to [https://www.0xboost.app/](https://www.0xboost.app/)

Scam domains:

* [0xboost.finance](https://0xboost.finance)

I want to share my experience that my staking money was gone in [0xboost.finance](https://0xboost.finance)

I met a girl from an online dating app and she added me into Line app. She talked with me for a week and then mentioned that she had earned lots of money from crypto in the past few years. I am not familiar with crypto, so she taught me some basic knowledge like what is ETH and what is a wallet, etc.

Then she told me there is a staking website [0xboost](https://0xboost.finance) , which provide several staking plans for earning the crypto. I had tried a small plan for 2-week with 0.5 ETH. Then I did reclaim my interest 0.01 ETH and my initial capital 0.5 ETH back after two weeks. The girl then kept asking me to do more investment, so that I can earn a lot of money and have time to travel with her. During that 1 month, she kept sending my pictures of her breakfast, lunch or dinner pictures and sometimes some luxury items to show she really did well by trading crypto.

She also provided some convincing news from other news resources, which are saying 0xboost has been invested by Binance Labs and other well-known crypto institution investors, so I believed that might be safe to invest my money on it. After I invested 16 ETH on 0xboost, the girl still kept asking me to do more investment. I felt that is strange, because I already invested a huge money on it. So I don't invest this time, then the girl blocked me and disappeared. Right now I cannot reclaim my interest - the system sent an error message when I claimed my money.

&#x200B;

I finally did some research from [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io)

0xboost owner address is: **0xdcbeefb14ba39092711d62cf3ea19af643f2c155**

The above address transferred my money to **0xe2D2E864EE0add55bF877351980bA79521f9b4f1**

and then it finally transferred to FixedFloat exchange, so my money should be gone.

&#x200B;

Please be careful

* 0xboost Binance Labs investment is a fake news.
* 0xboost data in Coinbase is also fake.
* You might be able to get back your money, if your investment is small. Once you invested a lot, your money is gone. ( There is a report that they will ask you to do KYC [https://www.reddit.com/user/lrdgrim4077/](https://www.reddit.com/user/lrdgrim4077/) . What is interesting that 0xboost just pop up an alert message today that they will not ask their users to do KYC. )
* Their team member pictures are the same as rocket pool ([https://rocketpool.net/](https://rocketpool.net/) ) I just found it too late after I already invested lots of my money.
* There is a YouTuber introducing 0xboost [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw-Z9e3zXH0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw-Z9e3zXH0)
   * If you leave comments, which is warning people that 0xboost is a scam, your comment will be deleted. So I suspected that the YouTuber is also a partner of that criminal.
* The criminal group should be very large, because the girl I met online speaking fluent Chinese. They also have the above YouTube channel to distribute English information.
* There is another report from reddit [https://www.reddit.com/user/lrdgrim4077/](https://www.reddit.com/user/lrdgrim4077/)

The three scam sites above share the same IP address with different domain names. They are run by the same crime organisation who operate pig butchering scams. Typically, a person with a fake profile from a dating website will pretend to be romantically interested in you, then eventually try to convince you to invest cryptocurrency (usdt) on these sites. Any funds you invest quickly leave the scammers wallet while leaving you with the false impression that your funds still remain. Any attempt to make withdrawals will result in a freeze. The scammer will then demand more money to unfreeze the assets, which they can do. However, all of this is futile. The numbers you see on the screen are just that, numbers being manipulated by the scammer. Be vigilant and spread awareness.",

They sent me to a site named BMClub and tried to get me to download the “app” called BMuift. They have at least 10 so called admins and the leader is named Yassine and his “helper” is named Beth. They are apparently trading futures at least once a day, but this week, they’re are doing two trades a day. 

There are some questionable red flags that I saw before asking an admin for assistance, that I may or may not mention, until it is verified that it is most likely a scam, so that I may alert others. 

The first major red flag was that the BMuift app they told me to download through a link was not available through the App Store. When I questioned this, Beth sent me a new link to download it directly off my browser. 

As I was searching around to see if the site and app was legit, I came across this subreddit again. (I was previously scammed years ago) 
I did a back search of the site which showed that the IP address also opened 724 other sites. 
Hesitant but still willing, as I was typing this, the biggest red flag came through WhatsApp from Beth, messaging me that they need identification documents and proof of address to verify my account. 

I have yet to reply back, and am now almost certain this is a scam, but also wanted everyone’s opinion on this. 

Thanks in advance. I hope if this is a scam, that it may save at least one person from falling victim.",

Somewhere in the scamming process they had her buy these ERC20 tokens with an Atomic Wallet which we still have access to, last I checked it was worth about $50,000 CAD.

I had her set up a Shakepay wallet, the idea was to convert the ERC20 token to Ethereum somehow then transfer the ETH to her Shakepay wallet then cash out.

I tried sending some of her ERC20 tokens to a Coinbase Wallet (Wallet app, not Coinbase app) and performing a swap to Ethereum but I keep getting an error to try later because not enough liquidity.

Any help would be greatly appreciated, I fear it might be stuck in ERC20 tokens and lost forever, she can't afford to lose this kind of money.

It's called the underage scam, a girl will be listed as over 18. In my case 23. They will talk to you for awhile before randomly sending a lewd photo of themselves. Soon after they will have their ""dad"" try to call you and say that the girl is underage and will demand money for the hospital bills because the ""girl"" hurt herself because she was regretful of the pic and in exchange will not press charges. In my case I didn't bite the ""girl"" began the conversation with saying her grandmother was in the hospital so I never spit any game and was respectful. Said I'd be a friend. Couple days in she randomly sent a lewd photo that I commented on but never said anything sexual.

I chatted with a girl, her profile showed that she was 20 years old, and she asked me for a private picture, I sent her one, and after I sent her a picture she wrote that “she was 12 years old and a virgin”  and she asked if it was a problem for me. I wrote back that of course it was a problem, she shouldn't even be on the platform because the platform is 18+. She also sent me a picture of a women but it was clearly not 12 years old. I didn’t even ask her to send me a photo she just sent it. Then I immediately blocked it and reported it to the app admin. After this incident I deleted my profile from the platform. 

I received a response from the platform support team:
 “Dear Submitter,

We have banned the profile in question, based on our investigation we strongly suspect that the person was joking, the pictures the person uploaded are most certainly fake (and they show a much older person), not real and almost certainly the age the person posted was not real. Regardless, the person was of course banned for abuse, as the person claimed to be under 18. We don't think there was any attempt to defraud or anything else with the information we have, simply that someone thought it would be a good idea to joke about such nonsense, unfortunately many people think anything is allowed on the internet.”

What do you guys think? Should I do something or should I just leave it and move on? It happened in April, but I  still have stress from this. I heard and saw some other similar situations that were scams.",

Matched with someone on Hinge, passed like 3-4 messages before she suggested to share numbers.

Within a day of just few texts, she sends me her nudes without me ever mentioning it. Asked for my pics, i just sent a half face selfie.

We exchange about 10 more texts for one more day before she suddenly disappears and after about 15 hours I get a call from police saying did you know someone named Emily. She was a minor and she committed suicide after her parents saw your texts and they had a fight. I ask him how can I confirm if he is police, he just says which department from he is with his badge number but it was so fast I couldn’t understand anything. And then he says her dad is going to call me now, i should pickup since her mom is threatening for charges since she was a minor. After 5 mins, her dad called and spoke in accent which I couldn’t understand anything. Afterwards, I again received 2 calls from her dad which I didnt pick.

Signs its a scam:
1. The entire story?
2. All the numbers are from different regions
 - Emily from North Dakota
 - Police from CA
 - Dad from NC

The police officer did speak like he could be one which spooked me a bit. What would you suggest for me to do now? Block every number and move on? 

If any chance this was a real story, did I do something wrong (apart from being stupid)? She mentioned 22 as her age on hinge which I took a screenshot of as soon as she sent her nudes.

The convos are going good, she keeps sending me a selfie every now and then and we flirt a lot.

Scams,Dating app scam called Kyle Evans,18exik7,Famous-Ad-8759,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/18exik7/dating_app_scam_called_kyle_evans/,"I met this guy on Hinge 3 months ago. He was supposedly in my city quarantining. He said he's a flight attendant and his colleague had tested positive for COVID and he's going to be here for at least a week. He claimed to be a Canadian working in Delta airlines. I spoke to him for a couple of mins through Telegram call and then we video-called for a while. Now he looked real in that video call, movements and everything. I have trust issues so I had to make sure too because scammers usually refuse to video call and this one asked me by himself. We added each other on Instagram as well. After that we shared our numbers. His number was from the US since he worked in Delta so I assumed he lives there. He had issues with his laptop's camera which went off frequently but he said he has some driver problem going on (which can happen as well if the laptop is old or something). He didn't have wifi in the apartment they were kept in and he was using a dongle. I felt suspicious when he started saying I'm hot and said I love you in few hours after we started talking because he was really good looking and could get any girl in the world, honestly. But then he sent me a picture of him holding his passport with his name, DOB, POB etc to make me trust him which I didn't really analyse. The reason he said he was single was because he was picky and his last gf cheated on him after 3 years of relationship. Sent me a couple of pictures which were smoking hot. There weren't shirtless pictures on the dating app and he looked normal on them. I didn't download the pics he sent at first. I live with my family so I couldn't talk while on video call so we video called and texted on Telegram and sometimes texted on WhatsApp as well. He introduced himself as Kyle Evans from Burlington Canada and other things about him like he's naughty and kinky which I'm as well. We had many other things in common, including cheating exes, so we hit it off. The first night we were talking, he became very naughty and started flirting which I did as well. Things got really naughty which I wasn't even expecting. I showed him a peek of my lady bits which was a new thing for me as well as I was in the dating game after years. Even gave him a ""birthday gift"" on video call which was a few days after we started talking. He asked me about my career plans as well. We kept talking all the time and he said I love you almost everyday but I didn't because I wanted to mean it and eventually I started having feelings for him. On my birthday (after almost 1 month of meeting on Hinge) I said I love you to him too which I really did. I always thought he was out of my league but people around me disagreed so I thought may be he genuinely does love me. He never asked for money or anything btw. In the last week of September before my birthday he said his visa was expiring so he'll have to go back and he had tested covid positive again so he won't be able to meet. He was still regularly saying I love yous and I miss yous. He left the country few days after my birthday. He was here for a month and I couldn't meet him but he said he'll be back soon after sorting visa thing. He said he lived in Burlington but his base is NY so he's mostly there. Then he said he was in Buffalo currently which was strange to me as main airports are far from there. He didn't go to work for a while and was stressed about the job. He didn't video call on his phone because his sim wasn't working (which I checked and it wasn't working) and phone had issues as well. Then he started going to work everyday and took flights from San Francisco (his new base I guess?), was stressed all the time but still texted almost everyday. I was a bit sus as he said he had a return flights from SFO to NY but texted me in 8-10 hours after saying he's getting ready for work but a single flight is like over 5 hours but I didn't want to overthink which I usually did. He always asked me why do I overthink. We had cute nicknames for each other and I was actually pretty serious about us. He wasn't being naughty since he left my country because of the stress. About 10 days ago he said he wasn't stressed anymore (because I was getting stressed because of his stress) and he promised me he wasn't. Didn't text me for 2 days at a time sometimes because of work which I can understand. He always showed concern whenever I was sick. Even yesterday when I told him I wasn't well. We were supposed to video call last week but he was kept on standby and then called to work. I was really upset even then. Then yesterday, we finally texted for more than we usually do these days and then he said he has to get ready for the day.

Now to the main part:

I had once reverse-searched a couple of his pictures which didn't come up with anything suspicious. He had sent me so many pictures, even of him when he was young. I didn't think of it as a scam or anything as he wasn't asking me to send nudes or any money and it has been over 3 months now. Last night, I was curious about something he was wearing in one of his pictures, so I reverse-searched it and the result killed me from the inside. This was a popular model who had worked in movies as well. I went on his IG and saw every pic/video ""Kyle"" had sent me. I was looking forward to a life with this guy. I'd have moved to any part of the world to be with him and I was planning to. But after what I saw, I'm shattered. Not just that, the photo he sent of himself with passport and Delta uniform were photoshopped as well. I can't tell you guys how much I'm hurting. I sent him messages confronting about it but he erased our chat and blocked me, just like that. Like I don't mean anything. I've rejected so many men for this guy and he turned out to be fake. I'm not even able to get up from the bed and typing this with tears in my eyes. I don't feel like living anymore. I wanted to warn other women on dating apps about him. He goes as kyleevans0911 or kyle.evans0911 on IG/telegram (currently it's kai.evs1109) although I had reported his IG that he was using someone else's pics and it has probably been removed (update: his profile is back). Model's pictures he was using is Clint Mauro. Please make sure you don't go through the same pain I did. I don't know what I'm going to do. My mom knew I was talking to him and brother and few people knew him as my boyfriend. I'm alone at home for over a week and my thoughts are really dark. I'm heart broken, you guys. I don't know why he did all this. I wish I had answers :'(

Edit: He used 'Kel' as his name on hinge when we matched. I don't know if he's using other dating apps.

Edit 2: He is using Kai on Hinge right now and location is set to Mumbai, India. Age reduced to 28 from 36. He's using different pictures of the same model. Beware.

Edit 3: I forgot to add that he was using VOIP number for WhatsApp which I had no idea about first. Onvoy LLC.

Edit 4: He has deleted his Telegram ID and will probably create a new one. I just noticed it in my archives. May be he found out I've exposed him or something. He'll probably change his name now.

Edit 5: His fake Instagram is back. Changed his ID to kai.evs1109. Update: It's gone 😎

Edit 6: His current location on dating app is set to New Delhi.

Edit 7: He deleted previous profile on Hinge and made a new one as Kai again, location still set to New Delhi but age is 25 now 😂 The person he is stealing pictures of was in late 30s when they were clicked. If he used these pictures when I saw his profile back in September, I'd have been suspicious 🤣🤣🤣 He also flips pictures now because he thinks no one will catch him again by reverse-searching them 🤦🏻‍♀️",

Thing is, in-between that, without asking she sent me pictures of ""her"" In a bikini, like 15 of them. I was like tf? Okay I guess. Never sent anything back, she said hey a couple more times, convos never went any further than literally what's up what you doing,  working. Today I get a text from her ""dad"" from her number, saying how she is a minor and he's gonna press charges, I start freaking out like wtf is going on. Then, an ""investigator"" calls me. I'm freaking out even more like dude I've literally done nothing she sent me unsolicited bikini pics, nothing nude or like that. The ""investigator"" told me I could be facing criminal charges and jail time if the family turns the phone in, I can't believe that this is even happening, he says he'll call them and see if they wanna settle personally. I call my lawyer (yes, I actually have a personal lawyer from my past) he tells me it's a scam and to cease contact with them. After more digging and calling the investigator back to get more of his information, he wouldn't tell me where he worked and the dad called me and it sounded SOO suspicious on the phone. From reading others stories it sounds like they were gearing up to extort money out of me. I'm glad I searched it up first and called my lawyer. Thanks to reddit and this community.

She asked me for pictures but I didn’t send anything and we didn’t talk much after that. The next day I got a call from her father saying I’m in big trouble and he is contacting authorities and sent me a bunch of screenshots with penal codes and such. I was completely freaked out thinking my life was over. I promptly got a call from another number which I did not answer cause I was still a wreck. I googled the number and it was a local police department. My parents told me it was probably a scam so I blocked the numbers. However over four years later I still worry about this sometimes. Especially since I have suffered from pretty bad anxiety in the past. I have been pulled over for speeding a few times and nothing happened though. I was never asked for money like most of the scams say which I guess made me think it could be real…",

I was not talking to him with the intention to date, first, because I didnt want to date anyone, second because I thought he was out of my league.

Why am I on a dating app? Because the friends' apps are too passive (but I am on them), I did find some good friends there. It's hard to make friends when you are older, and this area is tough. 

We met, we talked often. Then he supposedly traveled to California, then came back, and went to NJ to his daughter's house (supposedly, I doubt it). Went back to California, then he won a bidding and went to the Philippines to work on a project. 

While he was here, he had no time to Skype (supposedly). He said the Internet in the Philippines is terrible... And we will Skype when it's good. It was NEVER.

Enough is enough, I ran his Instagram photo on Face Checker ID. He is using photos from an influencer. His fake daughter has a fake photo too. The girl has only 4 followers. A medical student with 4 followers.

So, okay, I got it. It is a scam.  I just want to know what kind. It was not for money, because I told him I didnt make much money. I did send him some photos, never nudes. He could just get photos from someone like he did. 

I ""broke up""  with him because he is freaking me out. We were not dating, but I ended it. I said we could be friends, I was afraid of him. He just keeps sending me messages like before. Sweetie, hearts and all.

Scams,Instagram dating app scam???!,198mxkj,Intelligent_Cat_6891,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/198mxkj/instagram_dating_app_scam/,"Are me and my friends being scammed?!? 

I need some advice and opinions on a situation that's been making me a bit paranoid lately. So here's the deal:

1. I'm usually pretty paranoid when it comes to scams...for context
2. There is this account on insta, @/thedimpleapp - the idea is that it is promoting a dating app (we think) but the account has nothing to do with the app. It's just pictures of hot girls eating dinner.
3. HOWEVER - the dinners and girls are legit. The owner of the account paid for my friend to go to a nice dinner as long as she sent him pictures from it. She gave him her venmo and there didn't seem to be issues with payment.
4. Now, he asked her if she got her friends to comment on pictures on the account, he would pay her and each of the fiends $50 per day, if they got 3 people each to comment. We all agreed, and gave him our venmos. He soon venmoed us all after - and we began commenting things like  ""sooo cute"", etc. 
5. He said $50 per day, but he ended up paying us 3x $50 in one day... which is weird...
6. About an hour ago, a screenshot of a bank balance was posted on the account which automatically screams red flag scam!! My friend DMed it to him and said what is this? He said it was an accident.
7. I haven't clicked on any links or shared personal info beyond my venmo username

So, my question is, am I at any risk for being hacked or scammed? Is the money sitting in my venmo unsafe? Is my bank account at risk? Is my insta at risk? Could this be some kind of sugar daddy situation? Am I being overly cautious, or is there reason for concern? Has anyone else experienced something similar? Are we involved in money laundering?! Would appreciate your thoughts on this!",
Scams,Rondevo - Dating App Scam,17etpi1,ZookeepergameOld457,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/17etpi1/rondevo_dating_app_scam/,"I watched a YouTube video from a company that does Catfish-style investigations where a man had spent $100k on a dating app called Rondevo. This app requires you to buy tokens to do everything - read and receive messages, view pictures or videos, get someone's contact information (which apparently costs about $1200), etc.

The video makers determined that it was a romance scam, however I did some further investigation into the app/site itself and I don't think it's populated by scammers, but rather the vast majority of ""users"" on the site are just bots made by the website themselves to collect a paycheck.

The main demographic of singles on this website appear to be models based in Ukraine. The interesting thing about that, though, is that their terms of service bar people from Ukraine from registering because of sanctions. They list a caveat that if Ukranians complete identity verification they can register for the site.

Here's the thing about that, though. When you register, the site automatically pulls your location from your IP address, never asks you to put it in yourself. If you want to manually change your location you can, but guess what country isn't an option to change your location to? Correct, Ukraine, Russia, and other sanctioned countries are not in the list of possible locations. Strange then that the vast majority of singles on the site are there, no? Well, they all show as verified users so maybe that's the problem...

I tried to register with a VPN placing me in the Ukraine and registration would not complete, the sign up button would just spin endlessly. I tried another location to make sure it was a Ukraine thing and not a VPN thing and was able to register with no problem.

I emailed them posing as a Ukranian woman who was having trouble registering and wanted to know how to complete identity verification. No reply.

All the beautiful Ukrainian men and women on the site surely didn't have to fight to get verified, right?

It's because not only are they not real people, nor are they romance scammers, the entire site is populated by users created by the site itself so they can charge people who get addicted to talking to their bots.

Scams,Dating App Scam to get information from me,1c9sarn,VictorV10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1c9sarn/dating_app_scam_to_get_information_from_me/,"I met a young woman on the dating app Boo. Her English was a little blotchy, as is my Spanish.

* I often felt as if the conversations were a little one-sided or not going anywhere.
* She often would say that I'm nice (I know people in real life who genuinely complement exactly like that so I didn't think much of it).
* She told me she would like to speak to me over WhatsApp (I agreed, because even if it is a scam, there is little she could do with my number and because I genuinely felt that the request might be normal, based on where we were in the 'relationship'. I recommend not switching away from dating apps.)
* On WhatsApp she wanted to phone me 'immediately'. I say ok. Then she switches to 'she will call in 10 minutes' (presumably to get the voice of the group to speak). A female voices calls, that \*cooouuuld\* match the picture, but seems a bit younger and her English is quite a bit better. The personality between text and call are EXTREMELY different. Text girl is shy; call girl is a gigantic flirty, jokey red flag. She says if I come to her she'll 'compensate' me. I ask her to repeat, as I am unsure I heard her correctly. She ultimately wants me to provide more pictures of myself, reconfirm my name, age and basic information from prior conversations, which she ought not to have forgotten.
* I blocked her, flagged her profile on the dating app. I still have the number and wish I could post 

What have I learnt?

* I never learnt the endgame, but probably blackmail, asking for money or bank details eventually.
* I likely was texting a guy the entire time. Thanks for teaching me more Spanish!  ¡Muchas Gracias!
* I must say they were extremely patient. I almost lost interest multiple times. That's risky of them!
* Bye, online dating, hi asking out women on the street (again).
* Don't give your numbers to strangers. Say you are more comfortable staying on the app.
* I assume the young woman in the dating profile pictures is a past victim of theirs. My information and pictures may be used for future scams and identity theft too now (although they didn't get much info).

Scams,Dating App Scams are getting sneaky,16yo2vg,RepulsiveCandy,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/16yo2vg/dating_app_scams_are_getting_sneaky/,"For Context: I'm not new to online dating and I used to be in a long term relationship with someone from China (4 years). He had similar interests and the same issues with English as the person in question which is why some of this wasn't odd to me initially. For example, instead of saying free time, he said relaxation time and that's the same phrasing my ex used. However, I'm highly suspect that this person is a scammer and I wanted to share what happened so that no one else gets in this situation. I've seen a couple articles but they don't really go into any specifics I felt were helpful so here's my experience.

TLDR; beware the crypto bros and take screenshots of everything on their online profile


1. After chatting on the app for about a day he wanted me to add him to Whatsapp. Not unusual, I have friends overseas and in the US that use this as well as my ex. But my spidey senses went off when the next day he either unmatched or removed his profile from the app. 
2. Said his job was an architect and he moved to this area for a job. There are a couple of luxury architect companies nearby in the city and some of the companies don't have employees listed or pics (I looked). Thought it was odd, but not completely out of the question?
3. Seemed very smitten with me very quickly, but again, 50/50 from my dating history on if that's good or bad.
4. Said he was originally from California (specifically LA), lived in the US 13 years and already had a green card. Kind of odd for this area since it's weird someone would go from LA to my area of the south, but not completely out of the question.
5. The first flag that made me side eye is that he would say variations of, ""We can share and learn something fun and meaningful from each other together. It's great for two people to do something together."" Kind of an odd phrase to keep interjecting into conversion, but could be language thing.
6. Second flag, I had asked if he had any pics of the projects he's done as an architect and they looked like something off a website. I found VERY similar pictures, but not the EXACT ones he shared. I asked what his favorite style to work with was (like Bauhaus for example) and he said ""sleek. modern."" Kind of weird response for someone that is supposedly working in this field.
7. Discussed traveling a lot, but nothing out of the ordinary. 
8. Third flag, I asked what kind of music he listened to and he responded Pop and Electro. When I inquired further about specific bands, he text was ""Like. So Far Away. The Nights. One Last Time. Try. Cupid."" I had assumed this might be a translation thing and he thought I was asking for song titles.
9. He was usually out with his coworkers after work during the week, would often say they were having a BBQ on the weekend type thing. Kind of weird, but my ex had close friends that were also from China he hung out with alot and it wasn't unusual for them to go to the park to BBQ.
10. His selfies kind of looked like they were from someone else's media, possibly facebook, they didn't look super professional or photoshopped. Something about them seemed different, but I wasn't sure. I sent a couple selfies (just my face, nothing more) and I have a feeling those will be used in a fake profile by these people later on.

What I did find to be a red flag pretty quick:

1. He sent a pic of a bitcoin trade he did and said ""just made a trade, share my joy with you!"" I mostly thought he was just one of those dude bros super into bitcoin since he didn't bring this up until we had been talking quite a bit for about 4 days I think.
2. After that, he said ""If you're interested I can teach you so you can make some extra income in your free time too. and we can enjoy the process of learning from each other. what do you think?"" I think #5 above was leading to this.
3. Then said I would need to download a crypto trading app and he would teach me how to use it. (I know how to use it before this, I just don't trade in crypto).
4. Red flags abounded the next day, he said he'd walk me through how to trade and advised me to start with $5,000, said it can be withdrawn at any time and profit is around 15-20%. When I responded that wasn't going to happen he said, ""You can start with 1-3k lol. How much do you think is not stressful for you?"" 
5. I told him, realistically zero, I don't trade in crypto. he responded ""I can understand your concern, but how do you know unless you try? Practical action is the best, and I won't take you on anything you're not sure of. If you think this decision is wrong, you can always withdraw your funds on this app.""  I think this is part of the whole deal where they coax you into this but aren't super aggressive or anything yet. I changed the subject and he didn't try to change it back.
6. He didn't mention anything about crypto the next day so I thought that was done, but NOPE, over the next few days he kept asking how the process was going and whether or not I needed help. I either changed to the subject or made some excuse.
7. At this point we've been talking pretty steadily for about a week and half and hadn't met in person yet. I've been under the weather, so I wasn't exactly pushing it but normally I try to meet in person within a week at a neutral place if the discussion is going well.
8. Pretty glaring red flag today: he asked if I completed the trade for USDT crypto and I said something like, oh it didn't go through and I don't really want to trade and he responded ""What are you scared of? Does $ scare you?"" I told him again I don't trade crypto.
9. BIGGEST red flag was his response to that ""What I want is for us to build more common ground and have a better understanding of each other and do things together, but you don't even want to do that. and i made plans for you and I've always cared about that. and i'm not going to take you on something you're not sure of. and it's only a few $$."" After this, I took screenshots of the entire whatsapp message history. I only have a couple screenshots of pics from his profile before it was removed and I wish I had the whole thing.
10. Oh, OH, but he follows it up with ""you can go to the bank tomorrow morning so they will operate it in a more blocky way, but the staff is annoying and they will ask you a lot of questions. You just need to tell them that you did it yourself. No need to answer any of their questions and let them process it for you as soon as possible."" PARDON?? yeah, the bank is going to ask questions because why does this need to be done so damn fast and why wouldn't I answer their questions?

I may add some screenshots later, but at the moment I'm still playing along. If he asks again about the crypto I want to see if he blocks or sends more messages after I say no. It's already difficult enough to navigate the dating world, and this type of thing just makes it worse.

I don't know how much other people are running into this or if their experience has been similar or not?

Edit: forgot to add that the profile was for a Chinese man on the app",

I just replied okay and left it at that. The conversation disappeared the next afternoon. I tried to find it, but it wasn't under conversations closed by the woman, or even ""deleted users"".  I am speculating this account was flagged for review. Now I'm wondering what this end game could have been.

Scams,Love scam on gay dating app,1dktvek,chocolateboy06,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1dktvek/love_scam_on_gay_dating_app/,"I (m23) got played by a love scammer. Normally, I know a scammer in the online world, on the phone and even in real life. I know how to handle myself in these situations. I was on a dating app (it’s a gay dating/hookup app). I was approached by a handsome Asian guy (who claimed to be 35). Me being so vulnerable and gullible, I immediately thought he was hot. I never experienced much good dates and people.

To cut to the chase, he was very flirty and wanted us to chat on telegram. He was calling me all sorts of endearing names which really caught me off guard cause barely no one calls me those names. Even the some of the guys I dated never called me those names. He was very sexual also with me and naughty. However, the only thing was that the way he talked sounded like it was being translated. We were having genuine conversations and he said he wanted to protect me and he even told me how he got dumped.

I was suggesting though that I’m not interested in a relationship because he was abit far and I don’t do LDRs. He then started telling me he does crypto stuff and my guts started telling it’s a scam. However, I still wanted to know what else he’ll say. All of a sudden, he started showing me all this crypto shit. I told him I’m not interested and our conversation went blank (he didn’t block me yet). I then wrote “lool” and then he switched to a different person calling me a “bitch” (the he blocked me).

I blocked him on telegram and on the dating app. While I was able to catch him once he revealed the crypto shit, I felt like I was played and I’m so embarrassed that I like that happened to me. All I was looking for was a good guy to go on a date on and this shit happens. I also deleted both telegram (I barely use it) and the dating app. I’m ashamed I like something like this happen. As a gay person, why is it so hard to find a good bf.

but Now this girl actually offers to do a video call on the dating app, after her workday ends at a reasonable time and I figure… so I pick up and figure maybe... it’s the actuall girl, the weirdest 90 second conversation “how was your day?” cuts me of answering, wants to return to chat… and continues chatting love bombing And all. 

i tried to Google this scam, but most results suggested more of a WhatsApp video chat with someone undressing and recording it. So I was wondering if you guys know more about this specific scam. It’s so interesting to me because there is nothing reportable in that conversation. But at the same time the real girl (or a deepfake? Or a video playback? the connection seemed kinda shirty the first seconds so i Moved to better Wi-Fi and she seemed to react to that) seems to be in on it? 

tineye yields no results on her images though. ",

Scams,Dating app scams,103trb3,AboardTheGravyTrain,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/103trb3/dating_app_scams/,"Obviously there are a lot of scammers that frequent dating apps and the main ones are the bots that pose as women and send you a link to a porn site...

But I've come across a couple lately that are genuinely a real person on the other end. I've been bored a lot and entertaining these for a while, but I'm not sure how to deal with these... 

The first one was a Russian woman who supposedly lived in the next suburb over. No social media, only used WhatsApp and dealt with Cryptocurrency.
Obviously the whole thing was screaming red flags, but I was bored as hell and I wanted to see how far this would go.
So I added her on WhatsApp.
We were texting for a few days and the fourth night, I suddenly get a video call from her. I'll admit, this threw me.

This entire time, I was under the impression I was talking to some 40 year old dude, but there she was.
Anyway, we kept talking for about a week until she tried getting me into cryptocurrency. Obviously, I declined and she ghosted me.

No great loss.

Now I'm talking to another. A girl from Singapore. Again, no social media but has WhatsApp. No mention of cryptocurrency this time. She's sent pictures of herself and she's mentioned she'll give me a video call. 

I'm not 100% sure where this one is going, but I've just been added on Instagram by her. Brand new account, like 2 hours old (or at least she uploaded all her pictures 2 hours prior to adding me).

Apparently my settings on Instagram changed and she was just able to add me. My bad, I changed my settings again.

She hasn't mentioned to me that she found me on Instagram and added me, which makes me think there's more than one person dealing with this one. But I'm not sure what the endgame is here...

None of the pictures are getting any hits on reverse searching either, which is frustrating.

Can anyone give me some insight on the endgame of these scams? Obviously I just shouldn't engage at all, but like I said, I'm bored.",
Scams,dating app police scam?,19e50qt,Odd_Hornet_882,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/19e50qt/dating_app_police_scam/,"today i got a call from a number in utah (im in arizona) the person claimed to be a detective, stating that i was talking with a girl i met on a dating app that claimed to be 18, but was only 16. he said it’s my responsibility to confirm the girls age. his only “evidence” against me (or at least the only evidence he shared) is that i messaged her briefly, and then her parents walked in on her making a pornographic video that was apparently intended for me. he was saying i could be a registered sex offender and have a warrant out for my arrest. 

after about 10 minutes of this going on, he asked if i wanted to talk to the parents (this is probably where they would have asked for money), i said yes but then said “is this some sort of prank?!?” and he seemed to be very irritated by that, he said he’s just going to pass this on to his supervisor and he hung up.

i do not send nudes, i can’t remember receiving any nudes but it could have happened. i searched the number that he claimed i was texting, it was not in my phone (i could have deleted it but i don’t think i did)

i have already contacted local police and FBI, all they can tell me is that it’s probably a scam but they won’t help me figure out for sure (like by calling the “detective” or something)

i have severe anxiety and this is bothering me TO THE MAX. i have no appetite and im worried about sleeping because of this “warrant”

i know this is something i’ll probably look back on in a year and think “i can’t believe i believed this” but this is how my brain works, it’s killing me.

don’t worry i will not send this person money, that’s besides the point for me right now. this is just extremely scary to me.",

Anyway after a bit they tell me they don't use the chat on the dating app much and would like to move to another platform, and asks me which platform I prefer.

I suggest telegram, they say they prefer WhatsApp, I stand firm on telegram, and they give in and want me to send them my nickname.

With the excuse of having work early next day, I ask them to give me their handle so that i can add them later, and they comply.

Scams,Potential App Optimisation Scam?,16niq4m,skalavan,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/16niq4m/potential_app_optimisation_scam/,"A few days ago I got a message on Whatsapp for a freelance job from a ""Professional Recruiting Agency"".

I was curious and got in touch with the person who gave me training. So basically it is an ""App optimisation"" job where all you do is just click on a job and then click submit(You receive commission for every click). According to the training person we are giving apps 5 star reviews.

Do this 40 times and you have completed one task. Do this again and you have completed your check in for the day. Do the whole process again the next day and you receive your ""Basic Salary"" of 100USDT.

Now this is looks all legit, you login to a platform where you do all the ""clicking"" and then you can actually withdraw your USDT to a crypto wallet (Bybit).

But here is the part that worries me. Every now and then you get a combo task that takes all your money out of the platform and you have to top it up with your own money! So this is a big red flag for me. The training lady ensured me I will get it all back after finishing the task. At this point I was very curious so I did top it up with about £60 and took the risk. Sure enough I got it back.

Now I know this sounds like a very stupid idea but I thought ""fuck it"" let's see what happens. They even have a whatsapp group of about 30 other people doing the same thing and helping each other if you have questions. 

Next day I finished my two days and tasks and withdraw £100! So I made about £40 profit. I thought wow this is easy money. 

Today I hit this combo task thing again and the only way I can finish my task is if I pay £100 of my own money in! I stopped right there and left the platform. 

Has anyone encountered something similar to this?

If it is happening right now to you, STOP immediately, do not deposit anymore money.

It all started around mid May 2021.
I met this girl on Hinge, within minutes we were on whatsapp and she had unmatched me on Hinge. 
The conversations were very consistent, talking about life, family, lunch, dinner, ect. Ect... normal conversation you'd expect from a girl you are trying to meet online. 

Then the investing conversation would come in , I didn't think much of it and told her about my personal investments in Lithium and some crypto, to which led to her telling me about her ""XauUSD gold investments"".
She had mentioned profit and how it works. So I decided to give it a try, it was all my own account that I had created, sending money from Shakepay to my account on the Shengzhuo block finance. Due to the nature of how we spoke to each other, ""Goodmorning 🥰, ""Goodnight🥰 ""and so on, I was sure I had a met a nice girl and got very lucky she knew how to invest. 

So I started off with a small amount and made a bit of profit, she'd even shown me how to withdraw money directly to Shakepay, and it worked. Now I had some small suspicions of it being a scam, but thought ""Who'd talk to me for 4 weeks to scam me for $300"". 
So then, blinded by her conversations and words, I began to deposit more. 
A few times a week there would be a ""Node"" at an exact time of the day.. Ex : ""15:35"".
At this time I'd buy in exactly at that moment, and sell when the profit hit a certain amount. We would both send screenshots of our profits to each other.

She had convinced me to sell all my stocks and crypto as the profit on XauUsd was so much more. 
So I began to deposit more and more, I had even withdrawn $2500 from the account and it deposited into my Shakepay, so at this moment (around early July) , I was fully convinced this was all real and I got very lucky meeting this girl. Then she deposited $6000 into my account to top it up to $30,000 so that I could make $4000 profit each node.. I thought this was generous, but suspicious.. so I began to ask small questions, to which she would always steer my mind the other direction. And I didn't think much of it.

Then one day I tried to withdraw money and the chat agent said(July17) ""Due to deposit of $6000 into your account, the OSFI have suspected it money laundering, to withdraw you need to deposit $6000 of your own"". 
(I contacted OSFI in August and they said they do not deal with money laundering or deal with small financial institutions)


At this moment I began to freak out a bit, I started messaging ""Mandy"", who was so good at scamming, they would twist my mind into saying sorry, for suspecting them of being a scam, it was pretty fucked up. 
And just like that, I was right back on board, fully believing that once I would deposit this $6000 I'd have access to this $80,000 sitting in the account. 
So over time I stupidly gathered the money and finally deposited this $6000. Then... what a surprise I could still not withdraw money. Now the system was saying I had to pay taxes on the profits earned. At this moment I didn't know what to do, I was breaking down and didn't know what to do. 
Yet STILL Mandy was trying to make me feel bad about suspecting her for being a scam, but I'd finally caught on. Too bad it took me almost 3 months and $25,000 to figure it out. 

I contacted the Canadian Anti Fraud Agency and the local police. The Anti Fraud Agency told me that this is currently being reported thousands of times. 

Please. Do not let this happen to you. 
If you are reading this and are currently having it happen to you, please stop talking to them.
Withdraw your money.(if possible)
 No matter what they say. 

I learned this lesson the very expensive hardway. I hope by reading this it can save other people too.

Thanks for reading.",

Scams,Hinge Crypto Scam - Dating App Scams - Pig Butchering Scam,rin2ql,amazingpanda_106,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/rin2ql/hinge_crypto_scam_dating_app_scams_pig_butchering/,"I wanted to share my story with everyone that is online dating and the amount of efforts they go nowadays. Luckily I didn't give any money to these scammers but want to give this as a warning to all us out there.

Here is the story:

I was on Hinge from Toronto, Canada during November 2021 because I wanted to actually find a partner as we all have been stuck at home during the pandemic especially as a lot of people are working from home.

I matched with a guy named Jimmy and we had a couple conversations with where you are from in China (yes, it was a good looking Chinese guy) and our Chinese names. Shortly after, he asked to move the conversation to WhatsApp. Fine, so we moved over to WhatsApp to continue our conversation. His profile was gone within 2 days of us matching on Hinge.

We talked everyday for about 2 weeks with what we are doing everyday. Here is some information he told me while talking, Chinese man (claims to be from Hangzhou in a neighbourhood called Wulin No.1) at the age of 33, has a business to do model homes in the Greater Toronto Area and had frequent business trips so we cannot meet until the end of December. Immigrated to Canada as an investor immigration in 2017 first to Ottawa, lived there for 6 months before moving to Toronto. His GF broke up with him 2 years after he came to Canada since she didn't want to immigrate to Canada and has stayed single for over 2 years. He claims he lives in the Yonge and Sheppard area of Toronto with his pet cat, cooks, cleans and pretty much a ""dream"" man every girl is looking for. He sent pictures of his office, meetings (pictures with no one wearing a mask while having a meeting, go figure), food and scary part is also pictures of a local restaurant in Toronto with the exterior and menu (tried to look in Google search and did not find his pictures on there).

What gave me the red flag was he started to call me Babe, baobei or my love within a week of talking which is kind of suspicious as we never have met as our parents always say to be careful of strangers.

The talk of Cryto investing started to come in as one of his ""hobbies"" as he has started to invest small amounts in 2011, claiming his friend got him into it. Periodically he would send me screenshots of those ""investments"" and how much he was making. He was just throwing it into the convo throughout the day when we were talking. When he tried to get me to invest, he claims we should do something before we meet so we can grow something for the future. I did throw in saying he is apart of the ""pig butchering scam"" and he made me feel guilty that I associate him with those scammers and that he actually really likes me. Scary part is we did talk on the phone twice however during the phone calls, there was ""background"" noise when he should be home by himself lol.

After the day I suspected him of being apart of a scam, he started to have 18+ conversations and shared some explicit videos of ""himself"". Basic conversation started with when we first had interactions with the opposite sex and the last time he did. No, I did not send any explicit pics of myself (GIRLS, never send any nudes to strangers) but he did lol. Anyhow after that night, we continued to talk the next day with the typical greeting from him with baobei, my love, etc. He finally pulled the trigger bringing up Cryto again to ""invest"" and do something before we meet the end of the month. Told him straight up I don't have anything to invest and if this is a deal breaker for him, we should just end it. Afterwards, no messages from this scammer.

Final lesson on this is before meeting anyone, DO NOT SEND ANY MONEY to invest to make a profit no matter how good it sounds to be true. If it is too good to be true than it is. Yes, my emotional feelings were hurt but it's better than to be in financial debt because of the so-called scammer and wasted time which I will never get back. Final word for everyone, please be cautious the amount of information you share including personal information, address, place of work, income, financials, current circumstances as they will use it against you for their own profit. These ""slow"" scammers are everywhere and definitely on a whole new level most of us didn't see coming on our North American dating apps with Hinge, Tinder, Bumble, Plenty of Fish.

Nothing major happened to him so far,but this time I am a bit worried.
He told me on Christmas Eve that he is going to travel to South-Africa for the New Year to meet a woman he is talking to online. I don't have any information about the woman apart from living in Pretoria and supposedly having a normal office job. She never asked for money from him.
My dad had already spent thousands of euros to travel to SA, the plan is to go to Johannesburg where the woman will pick him up and take him to Pretoria. They plan to go on a safari trip on NYE,that's the only thing I know.

My gut tells me something bad is about to happen to him and I don't know what to do. Should I be worried or is this a normal situation? Have you heard of any similar stories and how scammers are trying to lure people in? Any advice is much appreciated!",

Scams,I think a man I was dating in real life tried to scam me - does this sound like a conman?,12szd5y,ChocolateBreakfasts,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/12szd5y/i_think_a_man_i_was_dating_in_real_life_tried_to/,"I met this man 2.5 months ago on the league (dating app). He said he had a high profile career in asset management, and while I was able to see a tiny bit of a digital footprint, it was very limited. 

For the first month everything seemed fine and normal, but I started to doubt his sincerity in the middle of March. At the beginning of April, he told me that due to a deal he was brokering between government entities in China and Sultan Al-Maadeed of Qatar, the Chinese government had accessed 3rd party data on his cellphone, determined that he and I had been spending a lot of time together through that data, and somehow was able to run a “check” on me. They apparently needed to make sure that I had no connections to government or business officials in the United States that would interfere with the success of this “deal”. He warned me that I might be receiving phone calls from Shanghai or Beijing and to not answer. 

When I pressed him on this later, because it made no sense to me, he changed his story to last year his ex girlfriend tried to expand her business to China, but it failed and due to that the Chinese officials contacted him to ask about her directly, and he just told them he wasn’t with her anymore and was with me instead and then gave them my info and they ran a check on me. I started to feel like I was being setup here, like china was going to be this big, scary entity that he could possibly use to justify like, weird requests or something. 

Anyhow I pretty much told him “look if this is some tinder swindler bullshit I have nothing” and while it caused some strife for a few days that died down. However last week, after one of my kids had a medical crisis and he wasn’t particularly helpful, I dumped him and then blocked him because I needed the space. He started emailing me and in one of the emails he offered to send me $15k to help with medical expenses, he just needed my bank account info. (His exact words were 'I can transfer or provide account info, your call.')

I immediately said no, because I didn’t feel like it would be appropriate to accept his money, but after awhile I started to feel really uneasy about the idea that he’d ask for my bank info and not just Venmo or something?

In the 2.5 months we dated, I only ever met him at hotels, from our very first date either family members were staying at his place, it was messy, or then it was unfurnished cause all his stuff was in storage, and then he broke his lease early because he didn’t like the building. He claimed to own a house in another town, but had friends renting it out. I never met his friends, family, co-workers, and he was very terrified of me being added to his social media, though he happily met my friends and was going to go to a wedding with me this weekend until I dumped him last week. 

Basically - this guy sounds like a con man, right? I’m not crazy, right?",
Scams,Hinge Dating App Crypto Scam - 75k lost!,t8adhh,bitcoingirl33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/t8adhh/hinge_dating_app_crypto_scam_75k_lost/,"I was a part of two romance scams.

The second guy was from Italy who was also a businessman who sold orthodontics medical supplies, They both apparently moved to NY first to stay with their uncle until moving to California about 3 years ago. We talked for about a week before they asked to move communication to another platform. They suggested Whatsapp. I didn't think anything of it because I'm Asian myself and know many people who use this app. 

Once talking on Whatsapp, I insisted on video chats to make sure they were real. The Spanish guy made up some sob story about how he once had an ex-girlfriend that he video chatted before while she was driving. Apparently, she got into a car accident and died and he witnessed her death. This was his reason why he didn't want to video chat and why he moved to the States. They both refused to talk on the phone insisting that they were embarrassed by their heavy accent. They delayed and continued to bail on times to meet up lying that they had positive COVID results or stuck on a business trip.

I should've recognized the red flags when they both seemed to moving very quickly on the emotional side despite never meeting in person. They would call me names like ""wife"" and ""my love"" and express their love to me in an absurdly short amount of time. They would talk about their future plans with me like having a vacation home in Hawaii and traveling all over the world. It seemed too good to be true, and it was. Eventually, they would ask for nudes and I'm not sure if this is all a part of blackmailing me in the case they got caught.

Soon enough, the topic of crypto investing came up. They both were adamant about the guaranteed gains and how it could open up a lot opportunities from a financial perspective. They promised the additional source of income and offered to teach me their ways. We started off small by wire transferring $1,000 to Coinbase. Then, that money was transferred to two separate platforms: (1) TCBit and (2) coinegglu.com. The first night of investing, I saw the gains as we short-term traded on these other platforms. 

The operation started in Coinbase where you would ask customer service on the other platforms for a BTC conversion link. You get a bitcoin address back and send the funds. You confirm the receipt of the Bitcoin and usually the verification takes 20-30 min. Once the funds were sent, they were ready to invest.

After investing a couple times with a low principal amount, they ended up pressuring me that the gains would be so much higher if the principal was higher. Even after expressing I was fine with my initial investments, they continued to press the issue providing resources to get personal loans and withdraw funds from my 401k and company stock. Even after getting denied loans, they insisted on asking friends and family for help. I almost got my dad to let me borrow 50k from him but good thing he said no. They ended up convincing me to take out 51k in loans and withdraw my stocks because the percent gain in short-term trading was higher. 

In total, I invested 75k. Eventually, I saw the pieces of the scam come together and so I wanted to withdraw some money. On Coinegglu.com, the scammer helped me withdraw $2,100 to pay for bills. The money went through fine and so it confirmed this may actually be legit, or so I thought. 

Couple weeks later, I tell this story about how my grandpa dying and needing money for medical bills. I beg for their help to help me withdraw the funds for this emergency situation. I was trying to withdraw 45k in Coinegglu and 120k on TCBit. When requesting a withdrawal from Coingegglu, the ""customer service"" rep stated I needed to pay 20% of my withdrawal funds as a ""certification fee"" to ensure the safety of the account and funds could not be withdrawn if the fee was not paid. They ensured the fee would be refunded in full after its completion. I pleaded with customer service that I already provided my driver's license and the account didn't need to be verified but it didn't work. I continued to receive pressure from the swindler to pay the fee by the 7-day deadline or the fees would be crazy. 

On the other app (TCBit), when trying to withdraw funds from the account, I received an IRS letter as a screenshot from customer service that I had to pay 30% of the total assets as taxes in order to withdraw the funds. The amount requested was 52,126.29 and needed to be paid within 7 days or high fees would be incurred. The letter was clearly fake as it was missing a tracking number and phone number and on top of that who receives IRS letters through Whatsapp. The letter didn't even make sense as it would tax me on my total assets I wanted to withdraw rather than the short-term capital gains. When inquiring with customer service about the notice, they said they are not the IRS but work with the IRS. The payment was in the form of Bitcoin and they would pay the taxes on my behalf. They refused to give an EIN number, provide a 1099 or W-4. Eventually, customer service got fed up and said if I did not comply, they would freeze my account and send the funds to a charity. Even when asking for the policy where these taxes due came from, apparently it required ""their superiors"" and would take time.

Scams,I got scammed on dating app by girl in Philippines,1cmurvc,ThrowawayAcc19755,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1cmurvc/i_got_scammed_on_dating_app_by_girl_in_philippines/,"This is a throwaway account. I was on a dating app (okCupid) and I matched with a girl from the Philippines. She messages me and right off the bat I could tell it was probably a scam just by the way she was talking (calling me baby, etc.). However I played along. Shortly after messaging me on the app, she asks if I have WhatsApp, to which I reply  yes. She gives me her number and I added her.

As soon as I add her on WhatsApp, I immediately regret it as I knew this was most likely a scam. But it was already too late and she started messaging me there. She keeps flirting with me and talking kind of dirty/sexual. Since I knew it was a scam, and I was already at this point I decided to just play along and I asked her to send me a photo. She then proceeds to send me normal photos of herself. I make a remark about sending more sexy photos. She then sends me a video of her getting naked. And another video of her playing with herself shortly after.

She then says that if I want more photos and videos that I would have to pay. She then proceeds to tell me she needs money for food, and she apologizes for asking and she says she hopes I don't get upset that she asked. At this point I should have blocked her, hell I should have blocked her on okCupid and not have messaged her on WhatsApp, but here I am bored and I know this person is a scammer so I decide to play along. I ask how much money they need and they tell me 3000 pesos and they send their PayPal account email. I said I will send the money but I need more photos and videos first.

All of the sudden my phone blows up with messages of her sending nude photos and videos. Then before I could even say anything she starts asking for the money and says that she hopes I'm not playing games with her.

At this point I go to block her number, but right before I get a chance to do that she calls me but it only rings once and she hangs up. I blocked her immediately after that and then I got anxiety because I was wondering why she would call me. What would that accomplish? And now I'm worried that maybe it's possible she hacked my phone and it's compromised now? I didn't answer the phone, she didn't send any links only the photos and videos, which I did click on. I know there are some spyware programs like Pegasus that are zero click exploits, which basically means that someone can call your phone and it just has to ring once and then your phone gets corrupted without you knowing. I know Pegasus is typically used by government/military but can these scammers use it too? Or something similar? I found articles about how this happened to WhatsApp users back in 2019 I think it was, but they were mostly journalists, politicians, etc.

Now I'm having anxiety about my phone being compromised and they could potentially see my photos, messages, email, social media, etc. My FB page was already deactivated before this, and when this happened I deactivated Instagram and LinkedIn. I deleted any important documents on my phone and have them stored in an external hard drive. I also deleted my okCupid account, but before I did I went to my messages and noticed that she was not there anymore.

My two main concerns are if my phone is hacked and the fact that they have my phone number, which I'm sure they could find out my address with, and since I basically got over on them I get worried maybe they would try to find me as I'm sure they're mad and might even work for some guy who might be pissed now. I didn't send them any photos or videos of myself. I definitely learned my lesson and will be blocking anyone like that right away from now on.

Has anyone encountered something similar and if so how did it turn out? Any advice? Thanks in advance.

  
Edit: I never sent any money. I just told her I would send the money once she sends me more photos/videos. She sent a bunch of them to me after that, and then she started asking for the money and said ""I hope you're not playing games with me"". I went to block her but right before I could she called me and it rang once. I then blocked her right after that. I think I'm mostly worried about the call. Why would she call me and let it ring just once and she only did that after she realized I wasn't sending any money. I just hope there isn't a way to hack into my WhatsApp or phone by doing that. ",
Scams,Online dating scam,16mslmj,Deadringerxxnyhcxx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/16mslmj/online_dating_scam/,"I was on that dating site Sakura date. I got friendly with someone on there. I definitely noticed a few red flags that were going up, but naïvely kept moving on. In the chats, they’re constantly trying to send you videos that you have to pay for with credits out of my curiosity I tried some reverse image searches, and eventually I got a hit and was able to find all the information on this person. 
It turned out that the person was not single like they said, and appeared to be married with kids. I’m not sure if they were playing me for the long con with the intentions of cleaning me out, or just robbing me, or what. I kind of went silent for a minute and they don’t know what I know yet. 
I was just seeing what you guys think? if I should play along a little bit further and see where it goes. I figure whatever money was spent on these transactions is gone and for entertainment purposes, kind of like messing with a beehive, is it a good idea? Am I still at any risk? How should I really go about this? If I play dumb, they will still just look at me as a victim. If I confront the situation and try to get some answers, they might just try to manipulate me even more and suck me in further to the lies. 
It appears that the girl might be a model and has like 130,000 followers on social media. Her videos don’t get many views. It makes sense to me that the kids she showed me were actually hers. She said it was her brother. The boyfriend/maybe husband is some sort of financial consultant which was also kinda sus. I saw some recent videos of them both pretty close and touchy-feely and they both have on a wedding ring band. Both profiles don’t say anything about marriage but his said that he was in a relationship with her since 2013. 
Just a little guidance here. It’s kind of a little upsetting but at the same time still confusing.
I’m sure if I played along, I could probably go out there (Philippines) and possibly meet up and who knows. Just knowing what their motives are is what really concerns me.",

What actually got my attention was people in this group chat posting about their earnings. Sending screenshots of their bank statements of them receiving the money. So I believed them.

On the first 4 days, I made around $70-$200 in a day and was able to withdraw my earnings and it actually went to my crypto wallet. 
I was surprised I was actually making money, and so I believed it's legitimate. I even had a plan about quitting my job and work on this app optimization full time. 

On the 5th day, I received $800 reward and encountered a combination task which I had to deposit $2100. So I borrowed money from my parents, made the deposit, then encountered another combination task which I had to deposit $2400. I told my parents what's going on and they tired to convince me it's a scam.

Her name was hidden (only the first letter was showing), so I didn't get that.

However today she asked for my number and immediately followed up with asking to know my birth date. I gave her my number (shouldn't have) since we had a nice conversation, but when she asked for my birth date immediately after, that kind of rang some alarm bells and I gave her the wrong birth date. So basically she has my name, phone number and a wrong birth date.

Scams,How does Crypto scamming on dating apps work?,1axiikj,Mr_Horizon,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1axiikj/how_does_crypto_scamming_on_dating_apps_work/,"I have encountered the following setup several times in different (european) countries and different apps (Tinder & Bumble), with similar texts and phrases making me think the scammer is following a script.

You match with an attractive woman (duh), who responds quickly and enthusiastically. Claims to be from an asian country, but is working in Europe and moving to your city soon (like in a month). The conversation quickly moves away from the app to a different messenger. She mentions that she is high class and makes a lot of money with the help of a relative (an uncle helping her with investment, or with a franchise company). Then she even posts screens of her investment app, which is when I roll my eyes and think ""not again!"" and report her.

**What is the end game here?** 

To rinse and repeat this process with many chat partners, hoping for one to say ""omg that's so cool, how can I invest"" and to take his money? It just seems SO MUCH work for something I can't imagine happening a lot.",
Scams,Dating App Scam! Please spread awareness,o4kzmz,Sushiandbbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/o4kzmz/dating_app_scam_please_spread_awareness/,"A close friend was recently was scammed through a dating app for $300,000 and she is a very mature, kind-hearted woman and the most frugal/hard-working person I know. She is smart and well achieved in her career, so it's hard to believe it happened to even her but these scammers are getting more elaborate and smarter. After trying to help her with no avail, I'm trying my best to get the word out to all my single friends and at least spread awareness. 

In a nutshell, it involved identity fraud and first taking the time to make sure she fell in love so that she trusted him completely over ~2 months. Casually here and there showed how rich and smart he was in investing and eventually introduced her to bitcoin. The site seemed legit, and long story short he kept pressuring her to invest more because he engineered an algorithm to show when the best time to invest would be and it was ""now or never"". The site later required monthly taxes to be paid on top or her assets would be frozen. By the time she realized it, it was too late. 

We've tried everything, it's very complicated but in short it's impossible to trace the real person/money unless the FBI was willing to get involved. Most disturbing fact was that when we went to the police, apparently she was one of many cases in the GTA recently - and for over a million in some. Apparent they target women, men, hetero or homosexual individuals. It infuriates me in so many ways, how they manipulate love and trust to this extent. Also shocked that it happened to someone close to me and in Toronto. Please warn your friends who are active on dating apps, just in case.",

Scams,Asian guy/girl from online dating mentors you to invest in Forex/Cryptocurrency Trading -- Sha Zhu Pan 杀猪盘 or Pig-Butchering Scam,na8oax,cannabiccino,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/na8oax/asian_guygirl_from_online_dating_mentors_you_to/,"I  want to raise awareness on this Pig-Butchering scam or Sha Zhu Pan in Chinese. So called because victims are patiently worked on  everyday for 1-3 months before scamming them big time, like fattening up a pig before slaughter. Basically, the scammer induces the victim into putting more and more money into a sham investment platform.

They are seriously well-planned operations (latter half of this post) and have really been successful in the Chinese-speaking world, so much so that Sha Zhu Pan has become one of the top Chinese buzzwords in 2019-2020.  Victims are scammed on average $50k, and millions have been  lost. It's a huge cottage industry that Chinese police has had a hard time stamping out. There are scores of recent news stories, blogs, video  clips, and other media online about Sha Zhu Pan victims and scammers. Sadly, *almost all are in Chinese*. I think the rest of the world has to wise up to this, because now as most Chinese are becoming aware of this Pig-Butchering Scam,  the scammers are turning their skills more towards non-Chinese, more so this year.

This first half is somewhat detailed, because since everyone is generally aware of romance scams, being vague won't convince someone who is in the thick of it and thinks that his/her online friend is THE exception. Exposing specific details of the Pig-Butchering scam is most convincing to current victims that the ""spontaneous"" events are actually planned.

Common tactics of the Sha Zhu Pan scammer:

1. greets you ""good morning"" and ""good night"" *every day*
2. always asks/share pictures of food. Their ""home-cooked"" food looks restaurant quality
3. are sole owners of beauty salons/restaurants/hospitals/apartments/businesses etc
4. casually talks about spending tens and hundreds of thousands of US dollars like no big deal (makes you feel small)
5. typically by 2nd-3rd week of talking everyday brings up an investment/trading website
6. studied finance/accounting, or have uncle/aunt/brother/professor who taught them Forex/Crypto trading.
7. talks a lot about fate and destiny.
8. asks what are your material goals and dreams, and say you're not dreaming big
9. trade on irregular schedules, based on a day's ""data""/candle stick charts/insider info. Sometimes they say ""tomorrow's data is not  good, I'll just go by myself"", sometimes ""today is a go!"" (to intrigue you)
10. laughs at how ""small"" your investment is
11. When some event causes huge losses for both you and the guy/girl, he/she suggests you borrow from the website.
12. When you're compelled by the website to pay some ridiculous amount, the guy/girl offers to ""help"" you pay half or so. You never see their money though because they pay directly to your ""account"".
13. guilts you, blames you, gaslights you, flip out easily, shames your  manhood/adulting skills/commitment to relationship, accuses you of  character defects, anything that hits home
14. always have an excuse for not wanting to meet up or do video chat -- bad experience with exes, pandemic, etc. Actually, they really can't. They're not where you think they are.

Common elements of the sham trading platform website:

1. Highly responsive ""customer service"" online or on WhatsApp, available to chat 24/7. They are always oh so courteous and never break character, no matter how much verbal abuse you  dish
2. When you've put <$10,000, you can take your money and earnings in and out
3. Offers large bonuses if you invest 30-100% more by a certain date soon (like this weekend).
4. Once you put in substantial amounts of money, the slaughter: You'll never be able to take anything out ever again.
5. To pay back ""reserve loans"", ""taxes"", ""verification fees"", anything, you have to *pay from outside;* they **cannot** be deducted from your ""account"" inside (they never say so beforehand).
6. Your ""account"" gets frozen for defaulting on loans, not passing verification, whatever. You have to pay in 7 days before they start deducting 10%  everyday from your investment and ""earnings"".
7. One time you send a large payment, they hurriedly tell you that you sent to a ""retired"" address!!! Later they decide you can make up for it by paying a 'reduced' amount.
8. Even if you pay everything, they'll keep coming up with reasons to prevent withdrawals. But your investment inside has already doubled! So you can't give up... and they'll never run out of  excuses

SECOND PART

When I said well-planned operation, everything has been [scripted and tailored](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/njimju/pigbutchering_scam_sha_zhu_pan_photos_of_training/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) to  your stereotype. Whether you a new college grad who never had a relationship, a lonely urban professional, a midde-aged recently divorced doctor, they have scripts for that. Generally, if you're a man, the scammer shows lots of sexy pictures and act hot & cold. If you're a woman, the scammer showers you with corny cliches and sweet nothings. Even the timing of when to call you cute names is  planned (\~2nd week). They make you think you're making all the choices and ""mistakes"". Maybe you weren't so greedy for money initially, but they know human psychology.

They're not some small outfit but a sophisticated corporate operations linked to Chinese triads (mafia) syndicates. They have head offices and branch locations. They have IT/telecom department, finance/money laundering department, and a ""sales"" department -- the biggest in manpower-- who do the day-to-day raising of ""pigs"". They are salaried, have time-offs and get 10-40% commissions for successful slaughters. They have training [manuals](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/njimju/pigbutchering_scam_sha_zhu_pan_photos_of_training/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and scripts they [update](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/nwz7ro/leak_of_a_new_script_for_pigbutchering_romance/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) every so often. New recruits undergo [classes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/o53g33/qa_about_pigbutchering_scammers_what_are_they_do/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) in finance terminologies and 'brain-washing'. Progress is reviewed daily in team or company meetings. Of course, implementation varies by skill level. Employees are actually treated harshly, and those who don't make enough get [punished](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/155702568).

The Sha Zhu Pan industry is thriving so much there are markets for fake dating profiles (\~$20 for basic authenticated accounts to \~$100++ for complete package with pictures and social media history). Most pictures are pirated. Hosts are typically late teens to 20s jobless young *men* from mainland China without college degrees, recruited or misled by ""online shopping"" firms in Southeast Asia.

Scams,Able: Personalised Weight Care app scam. Any help?,18tkqon,WhoMattB,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/18tkqon/able_personalised_weight_care_app_scam_any_help/,"If you ever see an advertisement from Able, do not purchase, don’t engage, don’t agree to a trial. Absolute Scam.

I went through a break up recently of a long relationship, I wanted to make some positive changes and saw their Ad.

After a survey they offered a custom weight loss plan, it all looked pretty good to me but i obviously knew it wasn’t gonna be free

Agreed to a $00.50 week long trial, which I thought was respectable, and then paid via Apple Pay. 

It offered a discount if you skip the trial, I pressed the button offering this (hoping it would take me to the page to display the price) and was then immediately charged £467.78 out of my bank account, no confirmation or nothing. 

My first month rent at my new place and I’m not going to be able to pay it, seriously, I’m at risk of loosing everything. I am absolutely devastated. I work pay check to pay check and have nothing fucking left. I’m so screwed. 

Their customer service has not been useful and I have so far been unsuccessful getting this back due to their “no refund policy”, which is absolutely ridiculous. I am going to try and take it up with my bank but I am not expecting much luck. If anyone has clue what we can do to get our money back please reach out to me, thank you.

TLDR: just wanted to loose a few pounds after a break up and now might end up homeless after a fitness app scam, can anyone provide any advice?",

Scams,"A typical scam on Dating Apps (Hinge, Tinder)",1awxhx7,Alive_Step357,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1awxhx7,"Hey Everyone,I want to shed light on a common scam tactic that preys on unsuspecting individuals through dating apps and cryptocurrency. 
Here's how it typically unfolds:

1. You match with someone who seems genuine on a dating app (#Tinder #Hinge etc)
2. Within a few exchanges, they boast about their expertise in cryptocurrency.
3. Intrigued, you express interest.
4. They swiftly move the conversation to a different platform like Telegram or WhatsApp, often by deleting their original dating profile.
5. From there, they'll work to convince you to send them cryptocurrency.

Remember, it's important to exercise caution when someone you've just met online starts pushing cryptocurrency discussions. 
Don't hesitate to halt the conversation if things seem fishy.

Stay vigilant and stay safe out there!",

Afterwards received a call from a dude with a clearly gangster looking picture, was told to confirm and transfer the money. Since I was suspicious at this point having not met the girl I told them I did not have the money. The guy started getting aggressive and threatening, saying he would get others to bring me to meet, before hanging up. I blocked all their whatsapp numbers and left promptly, I did not see anyone, not the girl nor them.

So my father and this person connected through FB and have been taking it really steady. They haven't met in person yet and until recently they didn't even video call. 

Something seemed really off given how they didn't really talk about her children much except them wanting a giftcard to buy some football game (red flag 1). She said the kids loved him and so forth. Later on he showed me a photo and something seemed really off.

I downloaded the picture and reverse image searched it and it linked me to adobe and several other stock websites. A perfect match (red flag 2). I take her profile picture and reverse search it and it led to a different facebook page ( red flag 3) then the one she was using. A porn star actress. 


NOW THINGS GET REALLY WEIRD.


He confronts her and says that he wants to see her face to face and it is her. She also went to the living room and showed the kids. again a perfect match. 

so either shes a porn star that lost a lot of weight and uploaded that picture and wants to forget that life, but uploaded pictures of her children for people to buy and use.......or....this is some weird bizzaro world. 

I am worried about my father and this is by far the weirdest thing ever. ",

(attached screenshot) for free for three months before becoming paid members.

I did not take that last step.

My research shows : 1. The profile of the Facebook poster changed name to Cathie W... in September. Previous multiple name changes also. The profile transparency shows the person is based in Vietnam. Reported to Facebook also.
 2. I found nothing on LinkedIn about Ava E.. or Jess P.. . 
3. Found Jess P.. on Google using his image from the WhatsApp number. Only one search result pointing to Red Sea Fortune Investment company. (attached screenshot) 
4. Red Sea Fortune Investment company domain name was setup less than two months ago. (attached screenshot)

Scams,Online Dating scam or am I Crazy?,15orxi0,poke-kk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/15orxi0/online_dating_scam_or_am_i_crazy/,"I have a friend (35F) who met a guy online who is supposedly living in Dubai at the moment for work (Native to Africa but not sure which country). She has been speaking over the phone for about two months with him and on occasion, he has sent her money via Western Union. I know this started as hair and nail money but now its evolved into bill money(larger amounts) and via Zelle. 

He recently sent a large amount of money to her ($1000+) and she didn’t feel comfortable with it and sent it back. I feel like this guy is testing the waters with her to eventually send a large sum of money, and then request it back (sort of like check kiting). He gave her his account number but she couldn’t really explain to me why he did that. Supposedly so she can set up the zelle transaction or account (cant recall) but that didn’t make sense to me.  He is a software engineer and cant figure out zelle???  

I also thought it could be a green card hustle because he has apparently already suggested that she go meet his family alone in NJ (we are in PA) because he wants to propose to her eventually. Again she believes whatever he says and he said, he doesn’t need her for a green card. (As if he would say he’s using her *eyeroll*)

She can be very gullible and has an excuse for everything that I flag. We have been down this road before and unfortunately she’s head over heels and blinded.

Please know I have let her hear my concerns and said I could be wrong but she should be cautious. 

Admittedly it takes me a long time to trust people so am I projecting here or does anyone else smell scam?

An attractive 37M contacted me 50F on a dating app. He asked me to tell him about myself, which I declined, instead I asked him to do so first - since he’d initiated the conversation. 

Straightaway he asked me not to repeat to anyone what he was about to tell me. Slight red flag there, but I reassured him that I would respect his privacy. I assumed he was about to admit he liked piss play or feet or wearing lingerie, I mean they’re all into that now and who cares anyway? Whatever floats your boat, dude 🤷‍♀️

Here’s the bigger red flag: what he actually confided was that his partner had died of cancer and her family had kicked him out of their home. I replied that that was TMI for me after exchanging two messages, and we should end the chat. He immediately blocked me.

It felt like a ploy to gain my sympathy - a clumsy one, but who opens like that? No mention of being widowed in the profile, almost nothing in his bio at all, in fact. I’m sure if someone has lost a partner they would want to say so, but to add in the precarious living situation and literally nothing else? And why insist on secrecy? (By the way - oops 🫢)

Either he was about to scam me, or the dating scene is especially tough for the widowed. Both could be true, I guess, but maybe others have experienced similar?",

I don't know where I got invited to this website from, but I found myself there. Lots of good-looking women (obviously!), so I signed up and paid $49 to be able to send messages to the women on the site.

In hindsight, I could have figured it out easily and should have done this before I paid for message credits but didn't....duh.  Photo searches!

The scam is simple - the women on this site are not from my area. In fact (after the fact, actually), doing a photo search with [tineye.com](http://tineye.com) or [yandex.com](http://yandex.com) or even Bing or Google showed that out of 50 ""women"" that contacted me, every single one of them was a fake profile. Their photos come from foreign websites lots of old Russian pictures and other websites. They are definitely NOT local and there will be no friending or benefitting from this website....

Every time the guy sends a message, the message credits get used up. Messages are limited to 500 characters (not words!) and the ""girls"" want to keep talking - lots of messages back and forth to use up the credits.

I call it a scam as this is purely a money draining website. The pictures of the attractive women are to entice us guys who might think we have a chance of meeting in person. But in reality, all they want you to do is keep messaging, keep buying credits and spending more money.

I feel pretty stupid that I didn't check the images first (I have the knowledge!). Bringing forward my experience with this scam site may save another sucker like me from making a similar mistake.

Scams,Massive “dating app” company scamming people.,1207but,Sadcupcake_uwu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1207but/massive_dating_app_company_scamming_people/,"A company called First Beat Media LLC. Is scamming many people. They have multiple websites related to niche dating. Handicapped dating, elderly dating, farmer dating, Christian dating, trans dating, any specific niche kind of dating you could imagine, they have it. I’ve been following this company for a while now, and I’ll share with you what I’ve found. 

*What they do.* -They claim unique domains and hope to sell them, while meanwhile offering a website (and app) that is virtually unusable. Their platforms are designed to have everything behind a paywall, to the point where it makes the sites useless. Every one of their sites and apps have the EXACT same layout. It’s free, but you only get to message 1 person, before you’re slammed with a paywall. Everything, every feature, you’ll be hit with a paywall before you can use said feature. Most of these sites are targeted towards the more vulnerable. When you get to the billing, the pricing is absolutely screwed up. You’ll get a “trial period” where it’s $1 a day. But after X amount of days, it’ll automatically start charging you a ridiculous amount. I should also note, that when you’re doing this, there is also a side option to subscribe to a completely different site..a foreign one, and the box is automatically checkmarked. If you miss this little checkmarked box, you’ll pay $1 that month, and then be charged $27.99 for a totally unrelated website. This companies services are purely designed to get you to spend money, unethically. 

*My experiment.* -I decided to test the waters on not one, but two, sites that are hosted by this company. As I mentioned above, every site has the same layout, the same paywalls, and the same scam tactics designed to mislead you when it comes to the subscription and billing process. They want to overcharge you after x amount of days after luring you in with a “trial,” in which you pay .99 per day and then after 30 days you get charged $27.99 if you didn’t cancel. ALSO, you’ll automatically be charged $27.99 to a foreign site after a week if you didn’t catch it. The sites are useless and unusable unless you pay. Regardless of them looking like promising dating sites. (I can extrapolate more in the comments if need be.) They also spam your email, and it has many type-O’s. (Could also show.) Fake matches, many fake accounts, made by them!

*What I know.* - This company has MANY apps and websites dedicated to this “niche dating scene.” Not ALL of their websites have an app supporting them. The apps for their dating sites all have negative reviews (1-1.5 stars.) People saying how difficult it was to get their money back, and being overcharged. The company has a LinkedIn profile, full of possible fake employees. The company has a website that lists *only a few* of their MANY scam-bait domains. After digging deeper. I discovered that the company was owned by a single Indian man. (This may explain grammatical errors on the site and the emails they sent me.) Not only did I find out about this, but I also have seen a picture of him.

*conclusion.* -It’s one man from India, hosting several dating sites and apps, to screw you over!",

Here’s the biggest problem, i didnt do enough research on this broker and there were plenty of red flags I didn’t realize. Spelling mistakes in emails I received, and a lack of information online, no phone number, and the address was what looked to be an apartment building in South Croydon in england. I bought my funds on Coinbase and would then transfer them to a digital address associated with Tufmarkets. she continuously convinced me to add more funds For greater profit. as I saw the ”profit” I was earning I decided to take out a few loans she told me about, luckily I didn’t take out far too much as one loan I deposited is trapped in this account and the other one I thankfully had not deposited yet. This has happened over the course of a month and just recently Tufmarkets website has not been able to be found when trying to access their website. It says server can not be found, on a blank page. i have been trying to work with my scammer to withdraw the funds but I’m counting on the fact my 8k is gone, a hard lesson learned… but the point of this post is to rally up others who may have had similar interactions and can share experiences with shady brokers.

Scams,WhatsApp group  crypto Scam,1cyxgh0,Wide-Ad2366,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1cyxgh0/whatsapp_group_crypto_scam/,"Something crazy just happened, let me just tell you the backstory first.

My aunt was unexpectedly added to a WhatsApp group on an app called MK-Z2. This group was managed by someone named Professor Mark and his assistant Jonnae. They claimed to offer crypto trading signals.

In the group, they persuaded my aunt to download their CATY co app and also advised her to download a crypto app like Gemini. Following their instructions, my aunt deposited $6000, purchased digital currency from the crypto app, and transferred it to the CATY co app.

Initially, my aunt deposited $6000 into the scammer's account. We tried to withdraw the money but we could only withdraw around $1000. The CATy Co account scammer's wallet placed a withdrawal restriction on the account, and only after the 18th of May, we could withdraw money from CATy Co. So, we planned to at least wait until the 18th of May and see what happens. However, before the 18th of May, while my aunt was in the middle of the trade, I pressed close on the trade and we lost all the remaining money that was on the account which was (5000 dollars my aunt's deposit and $4000 profit ). I think the profit that my aunty made trading in scammer wallets is fake because when I check the scammer wallet address on the block explore it shows a balance of zero. Here is the crazy part, my aunt again deposited around $800 (0.2898307 ETH) into the CATY co-account a couple of days ago, and she started trading for a couple of days in CATY co the account. It showed that she made a profit from 0.2898307 ETH to 0.34089 ETH by trading in a scammer app (CATy co account), I even checked the block explore, and at first, it showed my aunt's initial balance of ETH (0.2898307) in block explorer but during the second day it showed balance of 0. So we just tried withdrawing all the money from the CATY co-account and transferring it to Genimi. When the withdrawal was complete my Aunt Genimi's balance was now 0.34089 ETH, before it was 0.2898307 ETH.

I am sure it’s a scam but are they doing this to gain our trust so we could deposit more money?",

Scams,Beware of Bizvibe.info / Crypto Dating Scam / Pig Butchering / B2B Marketplace / Drop shipping Scam,1c4idxp,ything,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/1c4idxp/beware_of_bizvibeinfo_crypto_dating_scam_pig/,"I was recently caught in a very elaborate pig butchering scam that I have not seen discussed anywhere online. I thought I was fairly savvy with detecting most dating scams but lost about USD $30,000 from the scam. While it is a hard lesson learned, I hope my story can raise awareness to help others who currently are or may be caught in a similar scam in the future.

**The introduction**

As they all start, I matched with a girl on one of the well-known Asian dating apps “TanTan”. She started off fairly responsive on the app (unlike most girls you talk to) and soon after requested that we move to Whatsapp or Wechat. 

Her background was that she is 33 years old and based in Singapore, and was busy running a small beauty business in Singapore which is why she was still single. She would claim to be very focused on her career and building up her income so that she could have a successful life with her partner in the future. As she builds trust with you, she would tell you how much she enjoys chatting with you and sends a Whatsapp location pin of her house in Singapore by the water in Sentosa and screenshots of restaurants she’s visiting in Singapore with her family.

The first unusual thing about her profile photos was that she would be using photos from a popular Instagram model. When questioned about it, the girl would become very defensive and claim that it is her business account and she rarely messages anyone. When you video call for the first time you notice her appearance is slightly different from the Instagram model. This should have been the first red flag.

**How it starts**

While talking about her lifestyle and her career-minded focus, she would casually mention that she was running an e-commerce store on a B2B marketplace called BizVibe.info. Alternative websites are BizVibe.Co, BizVibe.CC, BizVibe.Life, BizVibe.Life, BizVibe.Biz.

[Bizvibe frontpage](https://preview.redd.it/xtxl68bt3muc1.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=09c8b5066b6ee5934147149cfa0e888ea015e745)

She would talk about the benefits of e-commerce B2B such as dealing with businesses that have a larger recurring order size than retailer customers, not having to buy physical inventory to display items on your store, and relying on a platform that provides payment protection to both the buyer and seller. She says this is called dropshipping, which sounds a lot like Amazon Marketplace or eBay right?

Every now and then she would show a screenshot of a chat with a potential customer on BizVibe, and an order size from that customer (usually tens of thousands of dollars with thousands in profit) as part of her business ventures. She would also combine this with stories and photos of her expensive visiting restaurants with her best friends. If you ask her to meet for coffee or in person she would say she is too busy but will hopefully find time in the future.

[The scammer's customer enquiry](https://preview.redd.it/oyfrq7ww3muc1.jpg?width=344&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=42f9a263e31891935e53f256401c08c42b16afe7)

[The scammer's customer orders](https://preview.redd.it/n2fzylbf4muc1.jpg?width=275&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=214b1572649ff4d59205570237ac9077f8dd0a12)

If you show a sign of interest in e-commerce and the store, she will then offer one day to show you how to sign up step-by-step, setup a store as a seller, and put items in your store and wait for customer orders. Below are screenshots of the BizVibe marketplace.

As one would usually do, I did some browsing online for this website. There is a legitimate BizVibe website on Google which makes the BizVibe Marketplace seem more legitimate as a website. Since there were no stories online about scams through the BizVibe marketplace (most seem to do with crypto trading) I thought I would sign up and give it a go. It seemed relatively low risk, realistic and a way to get some experience running an e-commerce store as I’ve always had an interest in this space. You trust that if anything is fishy you won’t put any money in. And that is how the scam starts.

**How it looks so real**

Being somewhat curious about how the e-commerce store would play out you fill the online store with similar epidemic prevention products that the girl had shown you previously and had made a bunch of orders from. You set the profit margin lower than other stores selling similar products to see if you could win some customers.

A day later you receive a message from a potential customer asking about the quality of the products on your store. The customer will say they want to buy a minimum order quantity of 50 units to test the product before committing to a larger order. A $370 order is pending in your store. Once the potential customer places an order with your store, you get a heightened surge of dopamine, fascination and happiness that the online store is working and that you need to fulfill the order right away. 

The girl advises you that you need to talk to customer service to load funds into the wallet to procure the order and wait for it to ship to the customer. Despite the red flags now obviously flying, you think it’s only a small amount of money and so you transfer some USDT from your wallet to the store wallet via ERC20. They take bank transfers for major currencies but they do not accept currency in the country where you are from. 

&#x200B;

[Bizvibe customer service](https://preview.redd.it/syafb7mi4muc1.png?width=351&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d3f2e02e17dbfb1a0a7053288f47db56c9d251c)

[Bizvibe customer service](https://preview.redd.it/zybhx6x05muc1.png?width=356&format=png&auto=webp&s=98ff4b496d24106f7b309d63a74227ac99c5942d)

After transferring you procure the customer’s order and wait for the supplier to ship it to the customer upon which you get paid after delivery by the platform. You forget that you should be procuring for just the supply cost but are paying upfront for the full cost of the customer order. Makes sense in the moment as an e-commerce store right?

**How they will pig butcher you**

Now this is where it gets interesting. Of course you would be sharing the news with the girl and celebrating in your first order together. Soon after, you receive orders on almost a daily basis from different customers wanting to buy epidemic products for different reasons, in different order sizes. So you contemplate whether to add more money to your store wallet despite having real concerns about whether you will actually get paid or not.

The girl also wants to send a gift to you as she hasn’t been able to meet you. Staying in accommodation when you return you find that there is a Louis Vuitton gift to you. You feel surprised that a girl has sent a gift to you for the first time. Is this real? Why has she sent it to you? Questions are circling in your head. She claims that a new wallet helps to bring you to build a new future and new wealth. She follows this up over the next few days with voice messages and more photos of her lifestyle in Singapore. She gains your trust even more.

During this time, you receive one new customer order a day of increasing size, each interaction slightly different with different order needs. When your initial orders have been shipped and the money returns into your store wallet, you think I’ll just top up some more to fulfill the order and maybe I can build steady cashflow for the future. Before you do you try to transfer a small amount out of the platform, which they process very quickly, giving you confidence to continue to build working capital for your BizVibe store. So you load up more USDT into the platform, fulfill new orders and also fulfill recurring customer orders.

&#x200B;

[Bizvibe customer orders](https://preview.redd.it/gg7kljl25muc1.jpg?width=740&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=666a3275d4319da32f5db8f59bea3174236f9080)

**The aftermath and investigations**

As you have probably worked out by now, it all appeared too good to be true with the orders piling up you and you quickly running out of working capital. When you cannot fund the orders anymore the platform will soon block your account for insufficient funds and make it impossible to recover your funds.

&#x200B;

[Bizvibe seller dashboard](https://preview.redd.it/m9yahad55muc1.jpg?width=748&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4295323c558d74f4f825c7d4dace9ba244b74202)

Upon further review of the website it appears that many of the same customer reviews are appearing across different stores. When you try to create a “customer” account to see if you can communicate with other stores or yourself on the platform they will ban this account claiming it to be a malicious user. Customers ordering with you seem very eager to try the product from a new and unproven store with strangely formal language.

The platform also looks surprisingly clunky relative to other online marketplaces and the customers always seem to respond to you when you are signed in. Customer service is also there ready to help with any issues 24/7. Until you stop transferring USDT to the platform.

Inspecting the USDT store wallet, one can see that the scammers will transfer out almost immediately any deposits to the store to another USDT wallet. 

And the LV gift? Well upon closer inspection, it was fake of course, adding further insult to injury.

In hindsight, the tell-tale signs of a scam were always there, but being caught up in a new dating experience, combined with the curiosity of starting an e-commerce business with relatively low working capital and the constant encouragement and attention from the girl can cause you to overlook these red flags in the moment in hoping to make a profit in the short-term. I hope those reading this who think they are in a similar situation seek the opinion from others or slow down your decision making.

**Red flags to look for:** 

I believe these have been covered in other posts previously, but I thought I would share some common themes in case you encounter them as well:

* They message you good morning and good night every single day and ask you fairly bland questions regularly such as “have you had breakfast? have you finished work yet?”
* They refuse to message you on Instagram saying that it is their business account and they don’t respond to people
* They message you almost instantly and tell you that if you are not equally as responsive to their message they think it is disrespectful and rude
* They constantly refuse to video call you, meet up or get on a call with you, unless they set it up in advance. They will also send you voice messages as proof that they are a woman
* They refuse or ignore your requests to send a photo of themselves but they send you photos daily of expensive lunches and dinners that they are having with their best friends
* They try to insult or gaslight you and reduce your confidence at a moments notice and then pretend nothing happened and continue the conversation
* They send you expensive gifts as a girl without meeting you first which is very unusual",

We have contacted the local police and submitted a complaint to the FBI, our concern is that:  
1. My wife's father still believes this person is real.

legaladvice,Dating app scam/prank,v19919,supersonic581,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/v19919/dating_app_scamprank/,"This happened 4 days ago and unlike a lot of the “father calling” stories I’ve seen on here, this is a little different. 

I was on a hookup app, matched with a 18 year old, we chat, then take it to texting. It’s a local number from a city a couple hours away, matching where she said she lives. We start talking about meeting to hook up, but things felt a little “off.” Then it happens - a common scam. She starts talking about gas and gas money and how how it could prevent us from meeting. I’ve seen this before so I decide I want to troll a little bit - a mistake as I look back on this. The messaging goes on for a couple days of me seeming interested and trying to poke holes in this fake profile.

Finally she asks for $10 to prove I’m serious. I refuse and say she’s probably a dude and I was surprised she only asked for $10. “You should at least ask for $50,” I said. Then… I start poking the bear a bit too much. 

She starts sending voice messages proving that she’s real. But while these voice messages are responding to what I’m saying, they seemed previously recorded in my opinion. So I say “well send me a video of you saying my name.” As expected she only sends a (non sexual) photo with text that says “Hi ____.” She can’t send a video and makes excuses why she can’t.

I say something along the lines of “wow, at least send me a voice message with my name,” thinking these are prerecorded and she can’t even do that. 

Then.. things get ugly. I get screenshots of our messages showing that I saved the voice messages (I didn’t do this) and then I get a voice message that I think sounded a little different, I think it was a guy but honestly it’s a bit of a blur. They say “are you seriously trying to jerk off to a 15 year old girl’s voice??”

I blocked the number (I reverse searched and got no name but know the carrier is sprint), then I got a text from another local number that again accuses me of this and says they have my address. They say they’re taking it to the police and “good luck bro. Blocked.” I block this number as well, block them on the app, and deleted the app. Reverse searched that second number and again no name, but the phone carrier is something called bandwidth.com.

I don’t think they’ll call the police. This was 4 days ago and I haven’t heard anything. There were no nudes exchanged. And I did not ask to meet after hearing “15.” Is there anyyy issue that could come of this? I would never think of trying to meet a minor and I’m just a bit rattled thinking some prank could ruin my life.",
legaladvice,Angry father dating app scam?,nmmp0l,tinderthrowaway817,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/nmmp0l/angry_father_dating_app_scam/,"So I matched with a girl who’s profile obviously said she was of age. Shortly after we start texting. She tells me she’s got relatives in my state and would be coming to visit sometime later in the year. She also tells me she’ll be 18 on whatever day whatever month, so I do a double take and say thanks I wouldn’t be comfortable doing anything with her if she wasn’t of age. She just says something like it’s no big deal age of consent blah blah. Yeah should have stopped the conversation there at the revaluation she was underage but like a dumbass I did not. She texted every now and then, first asked for a regular pic to save in the contact of her phone for me, and then as things progressed she led things to a sexual nature and sent a nude pic. I did sent one back so I may be fucked if it isn’t a scam. We talked a little more, she never said much or texted much. Then today, I get a missed call and voicemail from a guy claiming to be her father, saying “This is Mr. so and so her father, you have about ten minutes to call me back and explain what the hell is going on and help me make sense of this or me and my wife are heading to the police, do everything in our power to have you put in prison for a very long time etc etc, now hurry up because I don’t have all day!”

He sounded black and almost like he was doing a voice for a character or like….putting on an exaggerated act or sounded cheesy.  I texted back as soon as I saw his voicemail and just said look I’m at work, I had no idea she was underage, and apologized for any stress put upon him and said I’d block her and go on my way. He texted back and said I’d better call him soon.

After some reflection, and quick googling, I came across the “angry father scam”, and so I just gave it a few minutes to think through, and texted him back and said look, I’m very sorry for this but this is a big misunderstanding and that I’d never knowingly meet up or do anything with a minor. I also said this sounds like a popular scam. He just texted back and said he doesn’t care, he’s going to the authorities and that is better get myself a lawyer. 

He called and texted from the girls phone of course, and it was a NC number which some other people in a different thread said was the area their scammer was calling from, and due to the almost comical or cheesy nature f the tone of voice I’m hoping this was just a scam. Does this sound like it could be?

There was no mention on his part of a “broken laptop” or trying to get money for so and so’s therapy, as I’ve read in a lot of these posts. Just to call him back within ten minutes or he’d be contacting the authorities. I assume if I had called him back that’s when I’d get the rundown or he’d try to extort me for money. I ended up blocking the number and deleting the texts.

[Update] 

Just got another call from same area code. This time a supposed “Sheriff” asking me to call him back regarding the guy from yesterday and “inappropriate texts involving his minor daughter” and to give this “sheriff” a call back to his cell phone. This is still lining up like those scam calls, would a supposed sheriff call me?",

Her profile said she was in her 20's. We started texting and then she sent me a naked pic, asking me to send one. I said I wouldn't do it. I eventually asked her how old she was, and she said 17 but would be 18 soon. I told her that I couldn't talk to her again, deleted the picture she had sent, and was prepared to just ignore her. Last words she texted before I blocked her were ""o really I got your ass now"".

So, I'm already pretty freaked out. I don't mess with anyone underage. I'm pretty positive that this is one of those scams. But after sending me a full frontal nude, and then telling me they are underage, can they still get me into trouble with the cops? 

Edit: Houston area location. Her number was a Colorado area code, as she had recently ""moved"" to Texas.


Double Edit: So, the blocked number tried to call today (3/14). Since it was immediately denied, I received two back-to-back Restricted calls. Didn't answer either one. Assuming that was dear old ""dad"" calling to extort money.",

I started talking to a 19 year old one of the dating apps over the past weekend.    We traded phone numbers and a couple of pics.    They then texts me last night and says they have to be honest, they're not 19, they are 17, but turns 18 in a week.     That conversation was last night.    This morning, I get a phone call from a Denver number, but I don't answer it since I'm working.   I immediately get a text message saying it's Detective XXX from XXX police and he needs a call back ASAP or he'll be filing charges and send an officer to arrest me at (and lists my address).

I call the guy back and he claim's he's Detective XXX and that I've been talking to a minor online.    He gave me the full name of the person I've been talking to online and then said I can talk to the parents or else he'll file charges immediately.   He then gave me the full name of the father and his cell number.    We ended the call and less than 30 seconds later he calls me back and says he spoke with the father and he's expecting my call.     I'm freaked out, but this is starting to sound like a scam.     I called the police department that he provided and they said there is no officer with that name and it's a scam, but then again I was talking to a front line receptionist so I'm not sure if she was trying to get rid of me or not.

Here's what sounds fishy.

1.    The initial contact, the ""detective"" didn't leave a voicemail, he immediately followed it up with a text message.

2.   He's giving me the option to talk to the father or if I refuse he'll immediately file charges.

Isn't the age of consent in colorado 17?    Plus, I haven't met this guy yet.    The fact that I talked to this guy this past weekend on the phone app and by 10am on Monday I have a call from the police seems suspiciously fast.     What are your thoughts?   I'm 25 if it matters.   ",

They then requested a refund but I didn't see any additional funds in my account so I declined it, reported them, and blocked them because that's scammy. My Cashapp name is easy to find so I get random requests for money from people I don't know or get sent money randomly through the app and it usually resolves itself without me touching it, and then I'll block the sender/requestor. I thought it was one of those cases. However, a week later I checked the Cashapp and I found 2k sitting there. I was shocked, it wasn't showing before. Now this feels like a legal issue. I don't want to send it back in fear that they issue a chargeback and it ends up coming from my own account. I've been reading about all these scam types and now I'm paranoid. I'm just hoping that it goes away...but what if it doesn't?

I contacted Cash App support, and they said that since I had canceled the refund initially, that I should just secure my account so that it doesn't happen again.  I thought they would investigate or check with the sender in case they reported it as an accident? I called my bank and the lady told me not to worry, that I had the option to deposit it because it's cash, I was like what?...I really wasn't expecting Cash App support and my bank encouraging me to just keep it.

Need to know what my options are! I don't want anyone's accidental or stolen money and I don't want to lose my own money through an elaborate scam.

EDIT 11/16/21: I had some trouble wrapping my head around how it works but some of you have explained it pretty well. It’s a damned if I do, damned if I don’t situation. Cashapp support is horrible, by the way. Decided I’m not going to touch it and just forget that it’s there. If it’s still there a year from now I’ll consider it a Christmas 2022 gift, lol. I’ll post an update if it gets removed.

EDIT 2/21/22: I deposited the money after about a month and a half. Its been about 3-4 months and the money went through...nothing else happened.",

I've been on dating apps for a while and I haven't had much of an issue with them minus some rather sneaky/tough to cancel subscription type things. Months ago I cancelled my account but kept my subscription because I thought I may join up again. Months pass and I decide to get back on. I had a paying subscription that was being rolled over. When someone like myself with a subscription rejoins they have options for you to reinstate your subscription's benefits/perks. So I try that. Transaction Error. So I contact them. They tell me to try another email. I do that. Nothing again. I know for a fact that this email was the one I used for my previous subscription because  I have proof of receipts from Google. You're allowed to attach pictures to your complaint case, so I attached a photo copy of one of the receipts. I'm told it will be sent to another division. And this has been since mid February. No word on anything. Though I do see my ""ticket"" is still open. I'm still paying for my subscription. 

Clearly this is annoying and pretty unprofessional for a big company to dilly dally with, but it makes one think if this is happening to me and they're stringing me along as well as taking my money, it must be happening to others. Perhaps, lots of people. 

So as of now I've been denied perks of the subscription for over a month. Do I keep my subscription going to further prove how unfair the site is? It's beginning to feel illegal.  


Any thoughts on the matter are most welcome. :)

legaladvice,Date scam/dine and dash date - any legal recourse?,69oug0,datescam,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/69oug0/date_scamdine_and_dash_date_any_legal_recourse/,"I'll try to keep this short:

Went on a date from OkCupid. Talked to them for a few weeks, know his real name,

He pressured me into going to one of the most expensive restaurants I've ever been too. Said he really wanted to impress me. 

When we were seated I asked for separate checks. Didn't make a big deal about it, the server said they don't separate checks but will take two forms of payment. 

I had an expensive entree but one of their cheapest: around thirty $. 

He had an app, an entree that cost nearly sixty dollars, additional small plate type item. Several glasses of a very expensive whiskey for over $100. His entire meal totaled over $240 with drinks. Mine was just the entree and water. 

When time came to pay he flipped out, said I had agreed we were ""splitting"" everything. I literally don't have this kind of money so I kept insisting on not doing it he got really mad and said he was going to the bathroom and we'd settle when he got back

Of course he went out to his car and texted me as he left that he felt like he had been taken advantage of and that by going on the date I Had agreed to pay because technically i had talked to him first. 

I was so embarrassed. I asked the waiter what i should do. He said I had to pay for what we ordered and that they've called the police when people have dined and dashed before. Luckily I had my credit card with me and paid the bill and left. Is this a legal matter? What recourse do i have if any? small claims court? the entire principle of the thing has me so pissed off i'm willing to pursue whatever you recommend.

I'm in Colorado and am not a minor. ",
legaladvice,Dating app underage soliciting scam?,f9uatu,legaladvicescam5999,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/f9uatu/dating_app_underage_soliciting_scam/,"Hey, so I'm a 29m using a dating app to meet someone. This girl's profile states she is 19, reaches out to me (age of consent is 16 in my state). We exchange numbers (I use a burner app)  and first names (I give her my nick name which is nothing like my real name) and start chatting. Tells me that she goes to school, works and that her mother has cancer :( (Both of my parents died of cancer so I felt a sort of kinship). We exchange SFW pics/selfies. Naturally, the conversation gets a little flirty, and then she mentions that she is 17 and going to turn 18 in a few weeks. (remember age of consent is 16, but i'm no longer interested for obvious reasons).I feel it's a bit shady (the cancer thing really gets me though), but I tell her that I'm really busy and maybe we can revisit our conversation in a few weeks.

Overnight she sends me a more revealing pic (un prompted). Stupid me tells her she looks nice, but I'm really busy and that we can touch base in a few weeks. She then sends some straight up NSFW pics spread out the day. (2 to be exact).

She mentions again about her mom and school/work. That's my weakness there, so I just politely talk to her a bit more.

Later in the evening, I noticed 2 missed calls to the number i'm using. And then a text stating the local sheriff's wants me to call back to discuss soliciting a minor! WTF?  Eventhough she's not a minor, I went ahead and deleted my burner app/account/number, deleted the email address associated with it.

I have a feeling it's a scam, but I was shook up, thinking of ways my IP address could be traced to my home etc...

About a week and a half ago, I met a young woman (whose profile indicated that she was 19) on a dating app.  After a few messages, she asked me for my phone number and we started texting.  Shortly thereafter, the conversation turned sexual and, stupidly on my part, I sent lewd pictures to her.  She ghosted me and I noticed that her dating profile was gone.  I assumed that was was the of it.

The next day, however, I got a call from a man claiming to be a law enforcement officer, saying that the girl in question was only 15.  Naturally, my heart dropped and I probably gained a few gray hairs almost instantly, assuming that my life was over.  The girl's mother started texting me, and I ended up paying her over $1,000 on the grounds that she wouldn't pursue charges.  It was at this point that I realized that I was likely being scammed, and so a wave of relief came over me, and I just forgot about it.

Well, fast forward to a few days ago, and I receive a text from a woman with the ""Sex Offender Register Act Program"" (note the misspelling of 'registry').  She said that, because I didn't enroll in the classes, that I would become a registered sex offender at midnight that night, and that a warrant for my arrest would be issued 24 hours later.  So far, I haven't received any further contact from them, and the police haven't come banging on my door.

So, in summary, I'm 99.9 percent certain this is a scam, but I'm still freaked out.  I'm totally in the clear, right?",

This app almost specifically focuses on finding hook ups. It’s in apps name and everything else about it says it is. It’s called “HUD” if you were curious. With that being said, this is a 18+ year old app. I state this because I found out today my account was suspended for “messaging an underage account”. For context I turned 18 at the end of august.

As titled, this group in question is one of those Facebook “are we dating the same guy” groups (for anyone who does not know what these are check here “https://www.vice.com/en/article/dy375q/are-we-dating-the-same-guy-facebook-groups”)

Basically - a women I met on a dating app a year ago is now using an old screenshot of a dating profile (my name and photos) and attaching it to insane screenshots of texts I never sent. She is not claiming to have met me, but is attaching my name to bizzare text messages.

The texts don’t make sense, it appears she was caught cheating by her fiancé and is posting the texts in the group to protest innocence.

That’s fine, but this clearly affects me because my name and image (and thus reputation) are now being ruined in a Facebook group where thousands of people can see, including many people I know.

I have already suffered very intense emotional damages -  I can’t sleep and I can’t focus on work, and I am a member by a larger group who believe these text screenshots could be me.

She is never claiming to have met me, but random people in the comments are claiming to have met me in parts of town I have never been to and saying awful and mean things about me.

I had no idea these groups existed and were so involved, but it has been a very hurtful 24 hours. I also have a significant other now whos would reputation would be impacted by this.

What are my options? I do have the person in questions phone number and name.

Have had friends report the post but I am anxious to get this taken down and I can’t focus on anything else at the moment.

&#x200B;

Both parties are over age. Both in their 40s.  Female is Asian (chinese woman with not the best of English but is educated it appears)

&#x200B;

Location:  Female is located in Los Angeles, California  (supposedly)

Met initially through an online dating app.

There was never any vulgar or graphic language involved.  Any discussion of intimacy was in a mature manner (using the terms penis or vagina instead of the alternative). There were no nude photos sent. No nude photos were even requested of the other party. Intimacy at times were discussed.

&#x200B;

After a few messages on the online dating app, the conversation moved to texting and to Skype and Zoom (one session of Skype and one session of Zoom and nothing more)

General conversation took place:  What do you do for work, what area do you live, how many siblings, etc.

The first skype session took place about two days after the initial online conversation. The skype session lasted about two hours.  The male did bring up some intimate questions but the female did consent to having that discussion.  Once again no nude images were shown and the conversation was very mature (when did you last have intimacy, have you had many partners, do you prefer protection, she even asked do you watch porn and how often, how often would you like to see each other, how often would you want to have sex, etc.)  Nothing graphic such as what is your favorite position, etc.  Mostly the conversation was centered on discussing our supposed ex partners.

After the Skype. We chatted via text off an on for the next week or so.   At one point when the female was asked to be exclusive, she called up the male in broken Chinese English stating, you very controlling person, I no attractive to you anymore.  I wont speak to you anymore until we meet. After sharing that she has misinterpreted things and being told she can date whoever she wishes, she said okay, You are nice person and very smart and handsome person.  Next day she texts, I think I am in love with you.

Next day she texts the male about stock picks saying her friend made $4,000 on the Monday the market went up big.  She shared screen shot of stock picks. They all looked like crappy stock picks to the male.

&#x200B;

A few days would pass and she would say I am thinking of you and male would make similar remarks.

They agreed to a Zoom chat.  This last about an hour. There was more consensual intimate discussion but nothing very graphic at all.   The woman knew the male was out of town and she kept offering or asking for his hotel address or wanting to know where he was staying. She said, I want to send you money or put you up in a nice hotel.  The male declined saying that was very nice but not necessary.

Finally, there was more general texting.    The male asked, have you been watching any videos. She said what videos. Male said the adult videos we talked about the other evening. She said no. Male said he had been watching some to better educate himself. She said she liked that.

&#x200B;

Female asks, how are you holding up during quarantine. Male says holding up fine but missing companionship.  She said yes she misses companionship as well.

&#x200B;

After some generic text, male decides to spice things up a bit.

&#x200B;

he asks, do you like having hair.  Female says its 2020.  Male says you should have hair, it feels nice. Makes you mature.   She then goes nuts.

&#x200B;

Female says listen, you are a very controlling person.  I do not wish to talk to you anymore until we meet. you are controlling person.    Male said, Okay and apologized.

&#x200B;

Female then states, For your reference you have sexually harassed me. This is sexual harassment when you insist to talk about intimacy to another who is not interested. I did not consent to discussing intimacy with you.  You are very disrespectful to me and to women and this is why women do not find you attractive.

&#x200B;

Male replied he meant no disrespect and felt there has been a misunderstanding.

&#x200B;

Female says you can find female sex addicts online and they love to discuss intimacy. Unfortunately, I am the wrong person for you.  I can be a good resource for you to get treatment for your addiction if you wish to do so.

&#x200B;

Male said, I think it is best we no longer meet or communicate. You are a nice person and I wish you the best and I hope that you will find a great man to date. Can we agree to end peacefully.

&#x200B;

Female said yes, I wish you best and good luck.

&#x200B;

Then female texts again you were sexual harassing me!  you kept talking about intimacy to me without my consent.   Do you have a criminal record from Sexual harassment?

&#x200B;

Male responded I'm sorry but you have made some false accusations and assumptions. There is no addiction and you have not been harassed.  I do feel there has been a misunderstanding or miscommunication. Perhaps that is due to cultural differences.   Always tried to be respectful to you.

&#x200B;

Female replied, you are a liar. I am considering to report to the police this sexual harassment incident.  How many girls have you been sexually harassing through the online dating site?  Be honest, I am here to help.

Male said I've respect your wishes to no longer communicate but you keep communicating. I wish you happiness. Respectfully, I wish to disengage from further communication.

&#x200B;

Female replied, Did you ever see a doctor for your illness? Does online dating site know you have been sexual harassing girls on their website?  I'd see a doctor before getting into more trouble if I were you. I'd reconsider about not reporting this sexual harassment to the police if you agree to see a doctor for treatment.

&#x200B;

Male decided to not respond and make further communication.

&#x200B;

I do not see how there is any harassment here and if any, it seems to be from the female. The male seemed to be quite respectful towards the female and when she informed the male that he crossed the line with a question, he apologized and offered to disengage from further communication.

&#x200B;

Is this a scam?

Is the male in the wrong? Did he do wrong?

Sure enough after we sent the money they blocked us.

I know we should have looked more into it and saw that it was owned by someone else but I just want my money back. 

The person who took the money has a very unique name and I know where they live. Will the cops help me if I call them and explain what happened? Or is it my own fault for sending the money and I should just eat the loss?

I’ve contacted my bank. They’ve got me filling out paperwork on this. But it was done via Apple Pay. Apple wasn’t helpful and I’m a little disheartened and afraid that my bank will decline to help me.

legaladvice,Travel booking app scammed me under false pretenses of my flight being cancelled,13xmpow,pedrulo123,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/13xmpow/travel_booking_app_scammed_me_under_false/,"I (M24) recently booked a one way flight with the Hopper app for a work trip I have. For those of you not familiar with hopper its similar to Expedia where they find you the cheapest flights for where you are trying to go. They make money by relentlessly offering “upgrades” to your flight like vip support, flight delay guarantees, and flight insurance. I booked the flight without any upgrades since it was a simple one way flight and didn’t think much of it. 

About a day after I booked my flight I received an email from hopper stating that my flight had been cancelled and I would be receiving a refund within 5-7 days. Within this email there was a link to check the status on the app and take other actions besides a refund. I need this flight to be booked since it’s for work and I can’t wait 5-7 days for the refund so I clicked on the link that took me to the app. 

As soon as I got into the app a pop up appeared offering me to upgrade my booking to  have “flight delay guarantee” which would let me rebook the flight for free if it was cancelled. I didn’t want to have to wait for the refund so I went ahead and chose to upgrade. Here’s where things get really weird, as soon as I chose to upgrade I refreshed the app and the same flight that not two minutes prior was “cancelled” now said it was on time and everything was fine. 
It wasn’t that they had rebooked the flight for me since the other one was cancelled, it was the same exact flight numbers. It seems to me that they lied to me about my flight being cancelled to get me to upgrade to the flight delay guarantee. 

I’ve contacted the support team about this and they are unable to provide me a solid answer as to why this happened. They seem to be avoiding the question and tiptoeing around the fact that I received an email stating my flight was cancelled but the same flight was perfectly fine after I paid for the upgrade. 

I have screenshots of all of the emails I received and the conversations I’ve had with the support team. My question is, should I contact a lawyer about this? It seems like I have a good case for them lying to me about the flight being cancelled, but then again I’m not a lawyer so I really don’t know how to proceed. Any advice is appreciated.",
legaladvice,Help with “ghost app” hack/scam…?,rslrtz,rosewatermist7272,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/rslrtz/help_with_ghost_app_hackscam/,"
Hi,

I believe I have become a victim of a ghost app hack. 
About a month ago I began receiving text messages and emails with “one time log in codes” for several apps. Ex: Amazon, shoppay, DoorDash, PayPal. I ignored them. 
On Christmas I noticed three charges of a specific amount on bank from Amazon. I called Amazon and they said it was an order for “Amazon coins” I told them that it was not me and they reversed the charges and we reset my password. 
Today I tried to purchase something from Amazon and my account was locked. I called and reset my password again and placed my order. 
Shortly after I got a message from a ten digit number claiming to be from “Amazon fruad department” saying that there was still fraudulent activity and they needed me to text them payment and identity verification. I said I didn’t feel comfortable and they said I had until the end of the day or they would be locking my account permanently. 
I called Amazon and asked if that was them and they said no. I texted back and was a little firm telling them to stop. After some back and forth, they sent me a picture of vaccine card and they said “you’re vaxxed I should have known” followed by my home address. 
I called my mom and they immediately texted and said to tell my mom hello and used not her full name, but her nickname that only close friends call her. 
I went to the Apple Store and they said that nothing appeared to be wrong with the device or my Apple ID. 
I spoke with Apple support who had me remove and sign out of all devices and browsers. We reset my Apple ID. I also logged out of all devices on google and changed my gmail password. 
I called my local police department and they had my fill out two reports online “identity fraud” and “harassing phone call”. They also had my file a report with the FBI. 
I did a reverse number search and found the name and address associated with the number. I did this on my work computer, not an Apple device. I texted the number and they told me that person was the last person they scammed and that they would be using my number for the next scam. The said “ghost apps are fun” and “(search engine I used for the reverse phone number search) is so amateur”. 
So they knew which website I used on my work computer that’s not associated with my Apple ID. 

I am wondering if this scam sounds familiar to anyone and anyone has any input???

To be honest I’m hesitant to post my current plan and next steps for fear that someone can see everything on this Reddit account and the email associated with it as well. I am not scared for my safety, I live paycheck to paycheck and all my cards are maxed out so I’m honestly not a great victim. I’m just annoyed. Especially since we’re having heated communication. 

Looking for some possible insight and help. 

Thanks in advance!",
legaladvice,Am I being scammed? [online dating trap maybe???],9pnrrk,ballzyadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/9pnrrk/am_i_being_scammed_online_dating_trap_maybe/," About   six months ago in March of this year I was contacted via online dating   website Plenty of Fish by a female claiming to be 20 y/o. After brief   discussion with here over the messaging built into the app we switched   over to texting. After texting for a while we began to talk more   intimately and eventually she sent me a nude photo. After receiving I   replied with a nude photo of my own and shortly afterward, ""her father   grabs the phone from her, and texts me saying that she is underage and   we have to work something out or they are going to the police."" So being   scared shitless I agree and set up payment of $150 every two weeks   until I paid them about $2300. I cut that short after 5 months because I   was tired of paying it and they had stopped texting me. This was in   July when I stopped paying them. In September of this year I was   contacted by gmail supposedly by an individual named J S.  claiming that  he worked for the Department of Social Service:

"" Mr X,

My name is J S and I am with the Department of Social Services.

Your name and information has come across my desk in regards to an incident that occurred between you and a minor.

The incident in question has become apart of an ongoing process between the legal guardians of the child and the legal system.

I    have been tasked with acting as a liaison between my department which    handles victim impact cases, the family of the child as well as    yourself. 

I have  received documents   from PayPal Inc, which shows money transfers made  from you into the   account of the family. I have also been in contact  with the family who   have expressed the desire to not have this case  prosecuted or brought   forth into family court. 

As  of right   now we are at a crossroads because the mother wants sole  custody of the   child and the father is fighting this action. They are  currently  under  court order to remain in family counseling until  February 2019. 

The    reason for contacting you is to inform you that there is a balance on    the application processing fee of 1356.89. The father expressed that  he   was afraid to contact you again so he asked that I reach out to you  in   order to see if arrangements could be met in order to get some of  this   taken care of. 

The  mother of the   child is seeking legal action against you, but due to the  father  having  the device in his possession and refusing to turn it over  to  the  authorities, that is not a possibility at this point in time. 

So unless he decides to give up the phone, there is nothing she can do from a legal standpoint. 

I    would suggest your cooperation in this matter so that this file can  be   closed as soon as possible. That way it would prevent any further   legal  action from happening in regards to this matter. 

If you have any questions please contact me. 

Could you also send me your telephone number so I can give you a call at my earliest convenience. 

With warmest regards, 

J. S ""

Because of this email seeming so legitimate I paid them another $1350...

Now   I am now being contacted by an individual claiming to be from ICAC   (Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force) whose requesting that I   pay another $950 for something he claims is called the Unrestricted Sex   Offender Act... I tried googling this and found nothing.

I   am concerned that I am being scammed, any advice or thoughts are   welcome please. I am not a bad person and feel as though I am trapped by   this situation.",

I realize this is a scam and I am being a too nervous but I am trying to find loop holes in scammers story. 

&#x200B;

You meet a girl online, she says she is over 18. Sends you pics (even without you asking) next day a police officer calls your phone saying ""Her phone was caught in her school with these pics and stuff..... can I get your consent to have the father contact you directly; We have no evidence right now but if the father presses charges we will get involved....."" 

&#x200B;

Based on what I have read online ""The Father"" has no power to press charges, is that right ? In this scenario the police was called by the school so technically the police already has enough information to proceed with this and start gathering evidence. Or does the father have any influence over weather the police can proceed with this or not ?

Feel free to leave any more evidence to support the scenario or against it. Hopefully this will help people in the future as well.

I fell victim to an online dating scam of thousands of dollars to a real person from South Korea. He said he needed money immediately to avoid jail because he had been in a car accident, and that he would immediately come visit me if everything gets resolved.

After finding out it was a scam, I contacted lawyers in Korea so I can go prosecute him; however, he messaged me saying he was leaving Korea, and I am pretty sure he is coming to the States, because he said he applied for a tourist visa for the US (and probably used my information to obtain the visa as to why he's traveling!!!). He also blackmailed me with a photo he took (without my even knowing) and said that I gave him money for video sex! Which is NOT true at all, and I have evidence it was because of the car accident. This information came out of nowhere after I said I was going to sue him.

I filed a police report yesterday, and updated them that he may be approaching US soil, and they said they will get back to me. I'm not sure how long it will take for a detective to get back to me. Is there a way we can try this case in the USA if we catch him here? I am going through so much betrayal and heartache. I really want to get him for causing so much distress.

Thank you.

Edit: It was a screenshot. He gained my trust and I unfortunately fell for it. We video chatted, and I met his friends through video chat as well. He even spoke with my friends and parents...spoke to my mom for an hour. He sent me his passport, as well as his visa number saying he was ready to come to the States, and that all he needed was to finalize the settlement and law fines. I really fell for this guy and wanted to meet him. His passport picture does align with what he looks like on video chat, and I know his younger sister's information (haven't contacted yet). I know his roommate's phone number, but he's ignoring me. I lost contact with this guy after he kept saying I gave him money for sex and he's leaving the country.

legaladvice,"(TX) Dating Gone Wrong - Age Issues and Lies (Also, possible scam!)",ebijz2,SilentEvergarden,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/ebijz2/tx_dating_gone_wrong_age_issues_and_lies_also/,"First off, I would like to say this account is a Alt for obvious reasons. I am going to tell the story in as much detail I can because my memory is kinda bad due to my depression and the shock I am in, TL;DR at the bottom.

I am a 26 year old, single father living in Dallas, Texas. I have been using apps like Tinder and OkCupid to meet my matches to hopefully find someone to date and eventually settle down with. I was feeling pretty confident with myself as I recently got a job that I start training for in January. Now, I met this girl who I will call Crissy. Crissy was labeled to be 22-23 years old, an assumed college student, and wanted to be a Pre-K or K teacher. We talked on the app for awhile and she seemed nice and stuff. I asked her if she was willing to grab a coffee sometime and she said sure, but she wanted to text normally for a few more days to be sure. I agree'd and I gave her my number. I got a text a few minutes later from a number that wasn't from Texas, saying it was her and that she wanted a picture (selfie) of me for her contact image. I said sure and asked for one in return and I got a normal looking one back. I was somewhat put off by this because when I texted people in the past from numbers like that (especially if they live IN Dallas) that means it is a Google Voice number. When that happens, that means I am more than likely to get scammed somehow via CashApp or whatever nonsense. But, I do know that some people do that to avoid just handing their numbers out to random strangers that could turn toxic, which is fair and understandable.

We talked about normal stuff pretty much the whole time. I never talked dirty to her, never sent her lewd messages or images ever, no nudes whatsoever. The only thing I sent her, that wasn't a normal/clean selfie, was a meme of a bird that wasn't even dirty or lewd in any way. Then, a couple days ago I mentioned going out to a movie and she agreed. I drop my son off with his mother and head to the theater we were set to meet at around 6pm. I let her know I was there and she told me 5 after our set time she was on her way. I was a bit miffed, as being on time if not early is something I always strive for. Its just a personal thing. She was slated to come from Irving to north Plano, about an hour drive or so. I waited and waited, no show. I became annoyed, texting my mom who told me I should just come home and forget it. I decided to wait until about 7:15 and then tried to call that number twice to no avail. What bothered me too is that it said the Voicemail Box wasn't set up either, but, I ignored it mostly.

About 2 minutes or so later, I get a call from a random number. I answer and say ""Hello"" and the guy answers and asks who I am. I will showcase the convo as I remember it below:

""This is Crissy's father. How old are you?""

""I am 26 sir.""

""Where did you meet Crissy?""

""A dating site called OkCupid, sir.""

""Were you aware that my daughter is FIFTEEN?""

""No sir! I was not at all aware of that!""

""Well, I have to say that this situation is something I cannot tolerate. Young men like yourself getting lied to like this. The reason I am contacting you is that Crissy is in the hospital due to a car wreck. She is in the hospital because she stole her mothers car to come meet you son. I will say that I read your texts and you have been VERY respectable to my girl and kind. I can clearly see that.""

This put me aback. Holy shit, I was talking to a FIFTEEN YEAR OLD?! After hearing that I wasn't sure what to do so I let him talk. He told me he was a lawyer from South Carolina who had just moved to Texas. I listened as closely as I could because my hearing isn't great over the phone. He was telling me his wife's car was severely damaged and that the repairs would cost $1000 to fix. But, since I didn't verify his daughters age, I was partially at fault and should pay him half as a form of an apology. This is when I became unsettled and somewhat uncertain if this whole thing was real. He kept saying ""I want to keep this out of the courts"" and mentioning his ""families reputation"" and making it seem really strange. I was driving home during this call and he brings up CashApp. ""You can pay me there and I will send you receipts of what the money is used on!"" and all that jive, ""You can if get a refund if you think its fraudulent!"" that is what made me EXTREMELY uneasy!

I admit that I fell for a CashApp scam once before and can easily attest that CashApp will NOT give you a refund. They pretty much say ""Know who you are sending money to next time."" and you lose your money to a scammer. So, that alone made me uneasy. So, he is saying his wife is threatening to send detectives on me to try and find me, ect. and that I should just do this to keep myself off ""the list"".

&#x200B;

I wasn't comfy, nor able to financially, sending some guy I haven't met that kind of money. I also cannot stress that I have never met his daughter in person, seen any type of video evidence to prove her age or anything else, nor done anything that would be classified as sexual deviancy towards her. I also never got anything from her that was more than just a normal selfie, I never received anything from her that would be classified as a Nude or a Lewd. I couldn't talk to this guy either, he kept interrupting me saying he had a case in the morning so we need to fix this right then, right there. I wasn't feeling okay with that so I told him, ""I am not going to pay you, if you want to take it to court, we can. I don't feel I have done anything wrong and honestly? I find it weird that you are calling me and talking money when your daughter is in a coma. I am uncomfortable. If you want legal action, then I cannot stop you."" after that he cut me off again and I wasn't interested hearing anymore, so I hung up on him. I talked with family and friends about it and everyone seems to be in the conclusion it was a catfish that tried to scam me. Which, I feel it can be that too. My anxiety and depression are eating away at me though and I keep getting this ""What if though?"" in my head. I, of course, am freaking out. It seems legit in some ways but super scammy in others.

I also have an app on my phone called ""Do It Later"" that allows me to schedule texts to send out when I need them too. Crissy had mentioned that she was the only one saying good morning so I decided to try and do it more often, even if I slept through the text period. It would basically make it seem like I was texting first and stuff. I forgot I had that installed and set up with her number and this morning it sent a good morning text to her. The number replied saying it was going to go to the police because I thought this was a game.

Now, I am seriously needing advice on this as I am uncertain what to even look up regarding the situation.

I didn't touch the girl and never even met her, I didn't know she wasn't 18+ nor did I send her anything lewd or nude. At this point, I really don't know if that means anything anymore! As far as I am concerned, this is 100% a them problem, granted it is even real and not me being long-conned. Because I didn't tell her or make her steal a car, I didn't make her crash it, I didn't make her come to meet me. All of these actions were done by her own choices and don't directly involve me. but, can I be put on ""a list"", or even have anything done to me, if I haven't done anything wrong?

TL;DR: Girl lies about age on dating site before a date, father calls and tries to get money out of me because she crashed a stolen car and it was ""half my fault"". Possible scam, more details above.

I’m posting on here because my own situation is different enough where I believe it merits reaching out to you guys.

At the beginning of this month, I messaged a girl on OKCupid. She responded with her phone number, we began texting, and almost immediately she sent me several nude photos, along with saying she’ll be of age in the next month. Being the stupid idiot I am, I sent photos back. The conversation ended, I thought she wasn’t interested, and a few days went by. 

I then received a text from her phone from her father, threatening to take the phone to the police and pressing charges unless I call him. I spoke with him on the phone, and he told me if I send him money to pay for his daughter’s phone, he wouldn’t go to the authorities and we could all move on. Being absolutely terrified of going to prison and going to court, I scrambled and hurriedly loaded a card with the money he asked for, and paid him what he requested. 

About three weeks went by, until I received another message from that number. The father informed me that his daughter had attempted to commit suicide, and that she had been checked into a psychedelic hospital for her own safety. He wanted to talk, and over the phone told me that he was forced to pay for the hospital fees out of pocket with a deductible and through his insurance. He asked if I could cover the remaining cost of the deductible minus the money I already gave him to pay for the phone. 

At this point, I began doing my own research, and discovered that this is a fairly common scam. Following the advice given on other posts, I’ve been ignoring him for the past few days. Today, however, he sent me this message: 

*Guess we going let police an insurance company handle this I will be taking ur money to the police in the morning an signing a warrant on u so my insurance company can pay for every thing.* 

I would really appreciate any advice as to how to go about handling this situation. Do I continue ignoring this? If it’s a scam, he can’ press any charges since this girl doesn’t exist and I never really sent pictures to a minor. However, I did send him money, and could he use this against me? 

There is the case that this isn’t a scam, in which case I’m terrified that he will go to the police tomorrow and press charges. I thought that this matter would be finished after I paid him for the phone and settled things with his daughter, if he’s telling the truth, and the fact that he is continuing to ask me for money makes me think this is a scam. Any other thoughts would mean a lot to me. Thank you.

I started talking to a guy on a dating app several months ago. We have never met in person. He kept sending me crass messages on Snapchat, which I had been ignoring. I had made a date with him then cancelled it because it just didn’t feel right. 

After the last sexually graphic message, I told him to stop or I’d block him. I woke up to my Facebook (yes, I was stupid & friended him) spammed by messages visible to my friends. They consisted of disclosing a personal sexual health condition, telling me to stop calling him, texting him, he’s married, I don’t want to go out with you. I fortunately happened to wake up within hours of these being posted and was able to delete them. 

Here’s where I realize I went wrong. I had already figured out he was married, send the screenshots to his wife (on an old FB) and told her I’d be contacting his job. Which I really had no intention of doing, because honestly, it wouldn’t do any good. 

Tonight, I woke to my other FB spammed by comments that he & his wife had contacted their attorney, ordered a VPO, & for me to expect to be served, and they were contacting MY job. He only had my phone number, not my address, and I work remotely from a company with a local office but is headquartered in another state. 

Do I have anything to worry about here? He publicly defamed ME because he was butthurt over being rejected. His wife initially acted very apologetic, but when I messaged her tonight to make her aware he spammed me again, to tell him to leave me the f alone, she just said um, ok. He also did it to my Instagram. 

Is there even a case here? I posted nothing publicly (except under r/onlinedating , which I took down. If anything, I have a case because he revealed personal sexual health to people who had no business knowing. 

TYIA

Edit: FTR, I never called him, texted only a few times, basic crap like good morning, how are you then we moved to Snapchat. Now I know why, because that crap disappears. After his last gross sexual remark, he was like ooh you’re going to block me. Here are pics of my two year olds birthday party this weekend (which as his wife I would have been super mad) and it had a message that he had screenshot it.

Hi there.  Never thought I'd be posting here...  We had a little bit of an incident regarding purchasing concert tickets from someone on Facebook to a sold out show.  This is something I've done many times, both purchased and sold via this method.

Anyways, this woman says she has 4 tickets for $20 each (not much more than the initial ticket sale price) and we agree to pay.  She gives us her Cash App username, which does not match her name whatsoever.  Being nervous about that, we send 40 and request to see 2 tickets.  Once we received said tickets, we'd send the remaining 40 and be done.  

However, she came back with ""I can't send just 2 and have to send all 4, please send the remaining $40."". At this point we're worried and politely ask for either the 4 tickets all together or the $40 back.  Obviously if she sent the tickets, we'd send the remaining 40.  She says ""I promise I'll send the tickets just send the other 40"".  At this point I said that's not acceptable, and to please send the 40 back.  She replies ""let me find another buyer first"".  To which I said ""Absolutely unacceptable.  I will be opening a dispute with the bank for fraud.  Not exactly a road I wish to pursue.  I will be screenshotting this conversation and your initial post in the FB event.""

Annnndddd blocked.  I understand this is not a lot of money, but is there anything that can be done here?  Getting scammed just feels shitty really.  I also understand this is through an app and there's probably not much that can be done.  Just hoping someone maybe has gone through something similar and saw a decent resolution.

Thanks for reading!

I contacted Google and they could also see the purchase on their end, but they cannot help me install the app because the developer removed the files. Their refund policy is for me to contact the developer. Unfortunately, the developer removed his address too, so there's no way for me to contact him.

They were not able to help me after this. It seems to me that this is a scam.

I should:

   a) either be able to get in touch with the developer, or
   b) get a refund from Google because they are not providing me with the contact details, thus violating their own refund policy

Maybe there is some privacy law which prevents Google from disclosing the contact information? In this case, should I contact the Irish police?

Saying he has friends in the judicial system and that I will be spending the better part of  my life in prison. Initially he says that if I take full responsibility and pay half the medical bill he wouldn't press charges. But after saying I'd need to consult my parents and would need a face to face talk, he says he doesn't trust me and is going to press charges and that he can see me and my parents at the police station (They claim to be up in seattle and I'm in south king county.) Didn't respond after that initially.  


I didn't have the funds to pay myself which is why I needed to consult my parents and I wasn't going to send any money anonymously. I was sent an image of a bill but then realized as I was taking screen shots of it all, it was a stock image. Called them out today and blocked the number after being told 'see you in court' yesterday evening. And in my archive got a message saying ""Suck it B\*tch"" with a photo that with having the number blocked wasn't allow to load. Should I delete that for safety as well?  


Are there any possible legal ramifications I need to worry about from all of this? I'm just covering my bases and would like to know.",

So I get approved last Saturday and Sunday I sell these shoes that are worth $964. Monday morning I drop them off at UPS and later that day I check the app and it has changed my seller approval page and says that I have submitted a seller request which means I am no longer a seller and I can’t see the money I’ve made from selling. I’ve emailed them many times and even gone on twitter and tweeted them. If they don’t approve me as a seller again I lose $964.

legaladvice,GOAT APP SCAMMED ME FOR 1100 DOLLARS. DO I HAVE ANY COURSE OF ACTION,rs9het,Low_Interview_2414,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/rs9het/goat_app_scammed_me_for_1100_dollars_do_i_have/,"BACKGROUND INFO

First off I want to say that I’ve been using GOATS platform since 2017 when they were practically brand new. I’ve bought hundreds and sold hundred of pairs of sneakers on their platform not once with any authentication issue. Grails at that such as ow Chicago’s, Uncs, OW 5’s, Travis dunks, fragments, Travis 1 highs, both union 1’s and many other grails. I have superb selling history and just off selling them sneakers alone they’ve made over 10 grand from me 

HOW THEY SCAMMED ME

I bought two pairs of Travis Scott 1 Highs from goat back in December 2019 in which I sold one pair and kept another pair for myself that I only wore once. The purchase price for the shoe was 1100 plus the 12 dollar shipping fee. A few days ago I sold my sneakers back to goat cause I needed cash for 1,485 before fees as the shoes were honestly so clean they could have passed for DS. I get an email from goat after 5 days of them receiving my package that the pair of sneakers that I sold them are replicas. 

This makes no sense because I literally bought the sneaker from them and I have the purchase history from the two pairs that I bought from them as proof. So not only did I lose out on the sale but I am now in fear that I am going to lose the 1,100 that I spent purchasing the shoe back in 2019. 

To make matters worse they provided with me no reasoning on how the shoe is a replica, they sent me some generic message along the lines of the materials used and the shape of the shoe are inconsistent with retail pairs and if they buyer questions it they can’t justify it. Again, the sneaker was purchased directly from them and the sneaker still had the paper authentication sticker with all the holes for each verification step punched through it. I seriously have no clue what to do because now they won’t respond to my emails and apparently they are shipping my shoes back. I really hope it’s the same shoe because this is absolutely BS & as someone who has sold and bought so many shoes with zero issues whatsoever I am at a lost for words 

LEGAL ADVICE:

As they won’t respond to my emails now I guess I have to wait to get the shoe back in hand to conduct my own legit check and see how to move forward.

I am not rich and in no way can I afford to lose 1,100 dollars. Is there any legal action I can take? If the shoes are indeed a replica or even worse, not the same shoe I sold them?

I’m a law student in my last year and I’m considering representing myself in a small claims court once I take the steps mentioned above. As a certified reseller they have to stand by their guarantee of authenticity. 

People pay top dollar for sneakers for you to get it right, most people don’t know how to legit check sneakers, so if you sell a fake and they realize even years down the road you should be liable because you have now grown into a multibillion dollar corp that are defrauding consumers. Florida the state I’m in has good consumer protection laws so looking to use it to my advantage 

I’ve also filed a complaint with the better business bureau",

The person who contacted her then requested to start corresponding via email and ended up attempting to scam her out of bank info and is now ghosting.  Her account may be be compromised and might have to be shut down because of an attempt to deposit a fraudulent check that was sent to her for “purchasing supplies.” Does the company whose app she was using to find clients have any liability/accountability for linking her with a scam artist?

Nevada 

So I matched with a girl on a dating app and after a short talk we exchanged numbers. After such we exchanged nude pictures (maybe 3 days of talking). 
We make plans to meet up at a coffee place the next day and then nothing the entirety of the next day I figured she flaked until I got a call from a number claiming to be my local police department. They informed me that the parents of said girl were going to be filing charges shortly and they called me to inform me of such, and that maybe something could get resolved if I talked to the parents. I am freaked out at this point and immediately call the parents and spend the first 25 mins of this call trying to explain that I thought she was 21 (she also told me she was a manager at a restaurant so I never even crossed my mind she was under age) the next 20 mins is him explaining that once the parents found out the daughter hurt herself and is currently hospitalized and he wants me to help with the expenses or else he has to go to the police because he'll only get help from the state if he files it. I reluctantly give him a small payment and he informs me he'll call me back when everything is done, and email me a receipt with a bunch of billing paperwork from the hospital to ensure my doubts of scam go away, as well as try to let me pay the hospital directly. 

Did I get scammed, is this possibly true? Do cops even call you to try to ease things over in this situations? I'm so lost",

legaladvice,Have I been scammed? 25k is gone and no loan -- closing date was November 1st.,acdavc,caloraddi,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/acdavc/have_i_been_scammed_25k_is_gone_and_no_loan/,"I am an entrepreneur who has been trying to get funding for my start up.  I was accepted into a well know accelerator program and have been working hard to find investors for my platform.

A friend of a friend introduced me to a woman who does very low interest loans for specific start ups that ""give back"" in the niche that I am focused on.  I did the full application and was told that in order for the program to be so generous with 3 percent interest rates and no personal guarantee...that I would have to pay a 25k closing fee.  The money was coming from a man overseas who has done a number of big investments.  My friend of the friend -- works for a multi million dollar company that I have visited in person -- and he told me that much of their initial funding came from this woman's program.

I was concerned about sending off 25k and I did a lot of digging. I researched her at the local police to make sure there were no fraud claims on her...or theft.  Nothing.  I had her home address...checked that.  Called the bank where her account is that I would be wiring to...and they told me she had been banking there for over 10 years with the same business and it was an account in good standing.  I called the friend of the friend for reassurance and he told me ...yes, this woman has been helping dozens of companies through this billionaire overseas.  I also asked the owner of this million dollar company if indeed his investment loan went well... he said yes.

Well, my ""closing date"" was November 1st.  I gave her the money on October 12th.  The contract says if the loan doesn't close within 90 days ...that I get my funds back.

Since November 1...there have been ""delays"".  She initially said that Chase was holding her money from overseas...and I would have to wait.  I did.  Then, the week of Thanksgiving she sent off an email and blind copied everyone...giving apparently ""ALL OF US"" and update...  apparently I am not the only one waiting.

She said that Chase still was requesting more documentation and that one of the recipients of the loan had reported her as fraudulent because of their delay...and this caused hell for ""all of us"".  She then said she would be using HSBC because their accounts in London were out of that bank and she would need a few weeks to establish this with HSBC ...but we should get funding the week of Christmas.

We are now on January 3rd.  She hasn't replied to my call or email requesting an update.  I am trying to calm myself... my ""friend"" has been telling me all along that I am crazy to be worried...that this woman was legit...that I need to be patient etc etc etc.

I am out of money ...I need my 25k back...I REALLY need the funding...but at bare minimum ...I need my money back. 

If she doesn't return in within the 90 period as the contract says...is this just a civil matter?  Or could this be a crime?  I feel so angry -- and I want to do my best to expose this.  I think we are all part of a scam.

She is very prominent in healthcare and she has a large online following on Linkedin...etc.  Her testimonials are from people I know...so I stand to really harm her reputation if I take this public.

I messaged this girl on the app a couple days ago saying hey. She replied and said ""message me your number and I'll text you."" Keep in mind to use the Skout adult app you need to sign an agreement that you're at least 18. I was an idiot and gave out my number. She texted me next day and we sexted about 10 minutes. I received only one nude pic and it looked like just some random vagina. I sent a few things and she stopped texting. Today her ""dad"" calls me and says she is actually a minor and he's willing to not press charges if i'm willing to ""help him out"" by Western unioning him almost $5000. I'm really scared, I'm 25, live in DFW and never been in any trouble my whole life. I also have a great career. She supposedly lives in SC somewhere. Is he bluffing or not, that is what I'm faced with. If he isn't and he does press charges will I be okay since she lied when signing up for the site? The last thing I want to do is go to court. :, (




***Updated Information:***
I did as you guys have informed me. I blocked his number and didn't hear anything back until the next day. When I woke up I had another text from him (I could tell because it was same area code) on a different phone. It said ""(My Name), why did you block me? I was starting to think your a nice guy but I guess you want to get the police involved. It would be a shame to expose you at work like this as well"" 

ALSO, I received a call that had my area code in it that left me a voice message!!!
I listened to the voice message and basically just said, ""Hey (my name) I'm a sheriff with (my local police department) and I have a complaint about you with so and so's daughter and her father. Please call me back ASAP.""

I have a friend who knows an undercover cop, he traced back the original numbers the guy was calling me from.. both disposables. He checked the number from the supposed police officer, disposable as well. He called it and went straight to a voice mail.

I then called my city police department to see if there were any records or complaints filed against me about anything. Not in the database at all! Then I called the police department for another town over (I was told it was where the number was from or something like that, I don't know how numbers work like that) I  talked to a Sergeant for Criminal Investigations. I told him everything that was going on, he said yeah it's a scam don't do anything. He kind of had a laugh about it.

So that's where I'm at with this right now, I also changed my phone number just to stop this shit for good. I didn't get much sleep last night, I've never been involved with something like this before. Thank you guys for helping me out, I think I would have seriously sent money to the guy if it wasn't for ya'll telling me it's a known scam.

legaladvice,[Canada] Romance scammed on dating site but I have their contact info and place of employment,jfe2xx,cryptoarrow2000,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/jfe2xx/canada_romance_scammed_on_dating_site_but_i_have/,"
I virtually met a girl on a dating app and we hit it off pretty well. I told her I enjoyed doing cryptocurrency investments and she wanted to learn. For some reason she couldn't add funds to her account. I volunteered to send her funds but she must e-transfer me at the same time. I counted down with her and she said she will send it shortly. She never sent it, instead she told me she will just meet me for a date and will give me the cash in person.

I gave her the benefit of the doubt. Of course, she pulled excuse after excuse to not go on a date and I told her to just e-transfer the money back or send the digital assets back to me. She just blocked me.

Fortunately, I was able to gather enough info on her when we chatted. I have screenshots and chat logs of our conversation and exchange. I even have her personal phone number and found her on LinkedIn. I threatened her that I will report her at her job and she replied back saying she already told the exchange to send me back my digital assets and to stop bothering her. However, the exchange doesn't have the power to do that so I never got my funds back. I told her this as well. She has ignored me so far.

Info I have on her:

Full name
Full list of employment (LinkedIn) including her current job
The transaction ID of me sending over the cryptocurrency
Picture of how she looks
Phone number
Chat Logs of our exchange (I give her digital assets and she pays me back via e-transfer)
Her confession that she already told the exchange to send my money back

I'm just wondering what I can do with all this info. I feel like I can report her but I don't really know what to say. I feel like the police won't care and neither will her place of employment. It is a mid-sized company however. Any help will be great. Thank you in advance.

tl;dr
""Date"" promised me to e-transfer me money for giving her cryptocurrency. She never sent it back. I have her name, phone number, place of employment, and other proof that she has scammed me. I don't know what to say or do as the police probably won't care and neither will her place of employment even though it is an official mid-size insurance agency.",

The voice mail said they needed to discuss legal matters within their civil division. We thought this was a phishing attempt and wasn't concerned at first. Looked up the number and person calling and it was legit.

Apparently she was subpoenaed (maybe not the correct term) to show up in court for something the explained that was similar to Jury Duty. We never knew anything about this. They claimed she signed a paper and we never did. Not her nor I, we would have known. They claimed 2 people delivered it. Nope nothing. Asked for the date and time and conveniently, it was just over 90 days ago and my ring cut off 7 days before it.

They continued discussion with her over the phone but said she had to be somewhere by herself as they couldn't discuss it in the room. I left but over heard they are asking her to report to serve 72 hours in jail possibly.

My wife has a squeaky clean record and back wrapping up her BSN in college as a late learner. We have 2 special needs kids and she's been on the call for over an hour. I am worried that she hasn't ended the call and we decide to seek legal counsel.

Any idea about what this is about? Should we get an attorney or is this not going to be helpful? Any help here would be grateful as I don't know all the details yet.

EDIT: UPDATE THIS WAS IN FACT A SCAM. THE LONGER THE CALL WENT ON THE MORE WE REALIZED IT. This first step was isolation. Then the accent of the guy was normal for the area and used a legit Sergeants name. Even used a cell number in the area. When called the Sheriffs office, the real guy was out and someone there mentioned it could be his personal cell. The scammer gave us his badge number and knew everything about us (most likely a data breach). Gave us an exact time we were served but it was over the 90 days my ring stored so I couldn't verify it. My first thoughts was my MIL signed for something and never told us. If I had listened in to the call more I would have noticed a lot more red flags than my wife picked up on. Ultimately the real Sergeant called me back and I confirmed. We reported all the information we could to the county sheriffs office. This one address an area that my wife and I really don't know much about. Thank you all for the help and sorry to pollute this sub with scam attempt instead of actual legal advice. ",

My aunt lives entirely on the second floor and he lives on the first floor. The house is designed with a kitchen, living room, and bathroom on each floor.  We live in Illinois.

My uncle met a woman on a dating website back in January. My uncle had been talking to this woman on the dating website for a bit when the woman told my uncle that she had no where to stay at the moment and that she needed to do laundry. My uncle offered her to stay the night in the spare room on the first floor and do her laundry at his place. Only a night turned into months and she would not leave.

Eventually the police were called and they removed her from the premises and threw her in jail for a night due to an altercation. So she is no longer in the house. However after she was removed from the house and gone we discovered this gray bin. Inside this bin were loads of notebooks and a stack of blank lease agreements.

Inside the notebooks were countless pages of people she either sued or was trying to sue. As well as her written ideas for accusations she wanted to accuse people of. She had doctors, lawyers, police departments, landlords. So many people and from what I could see she has been scamming people since 2017 maybe even further back I'm not sure.  The way things are written in her notebook it is clear she is making up false accusations to sue people all across the United States. We found evidence that she was clearly going to scam my elderly aunt and uncle as well. She has recently set up a GoFundMe for legal aid. Her campaign states that my uncle illegally evicted her during the covid-19 pandemic because she denied his sexual advances and much more false accusations.

On the 24th my aunt and uncle are getting an order of protection but I'm worried that this woman is not just going to go away. Also it's on my conscience that she's just going to go out there and take advantage and scam more people. Can these notebooks of hers be used against her? Is there anything that can be done?  Or do we just let it go?

I'm not sure what flair this should be.

legaladvice,Dating app cancellation wasn't processed properly and I've been charged.,eskyu2,Gaynebula,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/eskyu2/dating_app_cancellation_wasnt_processed_properly/,"I cancelled my subscription to Badoo a couple of weeks ago. I didn't think anything of it- the user interface sucks and it seems pretty dead.

Today, I got a bill for £17.99, which pushed my bank account into the red. I emailed them, only to hear that they 'had no record' of a cancellation attempt, and therefore that, since according to T&Cs subscriptions are unrefundable, they wouldn't be returning the money.

Is it valid to enforce these T&Cs in the event of a technical error? If I needed to, how would I go about pushing this further? I've currently escalated to a supervisor. I'm in the UK but I'm unsure where Badoo are based.",
legaladvice,"[WI, USA] Online dating app profile accessed and upgraded by ex.",e0wanm,scruffapphacked,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/e0wanm/wi_usa_online_dating_app_profile_accessed_and/,"Hi all, I recently discovered that an ex had logged into my Scruff account (gay dating app, like Tinder) and upgraded it to the premium version. He did so in order to see all of my previous message history and social interactions and has since texted me information he could only have learned from messages on that account. This all comes after a tumultuous few months of mean text messages, seeing him parked on my block, and having him contact mutual friends to ask about me. 

I have contacted support on the Scruff app and included images of my Apple ID subscriptions page showing that my previous premium subscription ended 11/7 as well as my account showing a currently active subscription in the Scruff app. He would have had to use his Apple ID to get this subscription.

Admittedly I'm an idiot and had the same password for that account as I had used for a Netflix account to which I had given him access (to netflix, but I never authorized Scruff access). I have gone through the process of reporting to identitytheft.gov as well as with the IC3 and have been spending the night resetting passwords and adding 2 factor authentication to my accounts. I have also added a fraud alert to my credit and paused all credit cards.

I suspect this isn't the first time this has happened as there was an incident where I was locked out of my gmail account a month or so ago and had to go through the multi-day account recovery process. That account used the same password and I suspect he was responsible for that as well but I didn't realize it at the time.

Other than reporting this to the above agencies, do I have any recourse? Should I contact local authorities, any additional agencies, or an attorney? I'm mostly worried that there's something I've forgotten and he'll continue to gain access and use it to gossip/slander or something else.

I mostly just feel very violated and am unsure how to proceed. Any advice would be useful. Thank you.",

I went to visit Chicago and had a parking spot booked through a parking app for Friday April 9th at 8:00pm to Sunday April 11th 7:00pm. This was confirmed through an email payment confirmation on April 9th.
I arrived to the spot to leave on Sunday and my car was gone. I called the towing company thay had signs up all over the parking lot and they claimed that it was towed because the license plate was reported ""unpaid"" by the parking app. They towed it around 3:30pm on Saturday, a, day before the confirmed exit date. 
I paid nearly $300 and had to get an Uber to the towing lot.
My question is, who is liable for the cost of the towing (and ideally the transportation cost to get the car back...)? My instinct is the parking app because they failed to properly report the license plate paid.

(I deliberately left out the name of the app per one of the posting rules)

legaladvice,New house is being used in a rental scam. Can we be held liable? ,1dlur99,kaelhawh,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1dlur99/new_house_is_being_used_in_a_rental_scam_can_we/,"Husband and I recently bought a house in Rhode Island. Shortly after moving in, we were made aware that someone had fraudulently listed our house for rent on facebook marketplace. The listing is obviously a scam if you look at it in depth (monthly rent is about half of what comparable houses rent for in our area, and the description is just copied and pasted from the zillow listing and makes clear references to the house being for sale, not for rent), but someone was still dim enough to fall for it. 

We ended up with a knock on our door from a man claiming to be the new tenant, asking when we would be moving out because ""our delay is costing him money."" I told him that we're not moving out, that we own the home, and that our house is not/has not been/will not be available for rent. He called me a liar and said that he ""knew the landlord personally,"" so he knew that we didn't own the home. The altercation escalated to the point where I called the cops to have him removed from my property. It took over an hour to get everything sorted out, but here's the summary: 

1. Dude paid a few thousand dollars to someone named ""Robert"" for a non-refundable deposit and first and last months' rent. He does not have a lease, apparently ""Robert"" only does month to month rentals. 

2. My husband and I have never heard of this ""Robert."" Not my husband's name, nor was it the name of the previous owner. It also doesn't match the name of the person who listed our house for rent on Facebook Marketplace. 

3. ""Robert"" told Dude that his ""current tenants"" had unexpectedly paid for another month so we could have more time to move out, thus pushing back Dude's move-in date. 

4. Police told him that he was not legally entitled to be on the property either way because he does not have an active lease and has not received keys from ""Robert"" to assume use of the property, so they told him he had to leave. 

5. Dude said he's going to be contacting his lawyer, so we gave him the contact info for our real estate agent and the lawyer who did the titling for us. 

  
I imagine that what's going to happen next is that Dude's lawyers will get in touch with the our real estate agent and lawyer and confirm that my husband and I are in fact the legal owners of the house in question. From there, I'm not sure how things would go. Can Dude try to sue us for the money he paid to ""Robert?"" If he tries to, how would we prove that we're not ""Robert,"" and had no involvement in the rental scam? I know that scams like this are not uncommon, so I'm curious to know how they typically end, especially for the homeowner who gets caught in the middle. ",

tldr: Booked parking spot for Friday though late Sunday through app. Arrived to spot before ending time on Sunday and it was gone. Called towing company and eventually found out that the car was t towed on Saturday.

Since then we have contacted the app support, called corporate office and left a message, and have received NO correspondence through any avenue.

Not sure if this is worth mentioning, but some more info: the sequence of calls went like this the day of:

1. Called towing company and they claimed that they DID NOT have the car
2. Called Auto pound per suggestion of towing company employee, they did not have it
3. Called towing company and they then confirmed they had the car

I'm getting pretty frustrated on the silence here and I'm still out of nearly $300. Should I charge back the towing fee on my credit card? Should I file a complain report against the towing company (will that even do anything, realistically)? Is small claims court worth the hassle?

I'm mainly focused on just getting the money back at this point.

UPDATE: Got my money back! I pestered the parking app support enough that they put me in contact with the lot owner. They contacted the towing company and they are refunding it :) ",

Hey guys, sorry to bother.

I’m sorry, to be posting here. This is so embarrassing for me, especially because I thought I knew better than this.

It all started a couple of days ago. I downloaded this dating app, and there was this girl who contacted me. I was stunned and excited that someone as gorgeous as her would be interested in me. So I messaged back, we talked for a bit, and then she said she wanted to video chat. I generally know better, but in this case, I was so excited I said yes.

Anyway, she wanted to sex chat through skype and I agreed. Shortly into the middle of it, the video cut off, and showed my Facebook, as well as a replay of my side of the chat. That’s when I realized the girl I was talking to was actually a recorded video, and the person in the account was probably fake too. So they know my fb account, all my contacts, and they have a recording of my side of the sex chat.

They demanded money from me through a transfer and I gave it to them everything I had, and they promised to delete it later that night. But when the time came, they said the needed more money, and that if I didn’t they would post it on my fb page and send it to all my friends. I told them I had no more money, but they told me to find a way.

I really need help. Please guys, I’m desperate.",
legaladvice,(Wales) Sexually harassed by a coworker on a dating app,8ketuq,throwaway2091293,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/8ketuq/wales_sexually_harassed_by_a_coworker_on_a_dating/,"\(Wales\)

Hi guys,

Last night I got a couple of messages from a manager at my job, offering me a pay rise if I slept with him. He refused to give me a photograph when I asked, but gave me his facebook profile. I asked him to verify it was him by messaging me, so I could find out exactly who it was and who I had to report. He refused, and said that I could use any facebook messages against him.

After I said I was getting freaked out, he changed his tune and claimed to be just a coworker, and sent me several selfies, before continuing to try and hook up with me. This included sending me an unsolicited photo of his penis. After I made it clear that I wasn't interested, he blocked me.

I screenshotted the entire exchange as evidence, the issue I have is that I haven't got a way to *definitively* prove it was the person he claimed to be. It could just as easily be the manager trying to cover his back as the coworker harassing me. It could even be a third party, trying to get one \(or both\) of those people in trouble. All I know is that the person in question not only which company I work for, but which floor I work in at the business in question.

I've asked several people what my next step here should be, because I'm honestly scared of going back to work tomorrow. I've been advised to report it to a manager or HR, but I've also been advised that they're likely to try and sweep it under the rug to protect the company. Other people have told me to contact the union, since their first priority would be my interests, but then I've also been told that this would cause issues since I immediately went in that direction before trying to sort the problem out internally. The issue is that since I don't have any definitive proof of who, exactly, it was, outside of a couple of pictures of someone coming from an account, when the person in question had already claimed to be someone else within the same conversation. I can imagine that this could complicate things greatly if I tried to have this issue dealt with internally.

What would my next steps be in this case?

Any help would be appreciated.",

gf signed up for dating apps without my knowledge, I found out about it and I can’t decide on what to do.

Not sure what to do about this but here I am seeking for advice/help on this.

Just found out that my gf who initiated and wanted an exclusive and monogamous relationship with me created dating profiles on multiple dating apps.

We have been dating for almost 7 months now and it is heartbreaking to see this.

There are no signs of her meeting up with anyone from what I’ve gathered but still I can’t process why she would do such.

She has been on the apps for a couple of weeks now and I just found out about 3 days ago.

Should I bring this up to her? Should I just leave without saying anything? Should I bring this up in front of her family and friends? Should I just send her screenshots of her profile and move on? Should I try and ask her why she did? Should act like nothing is going on? 

I feel like I’ve been backstabbed.",
relationships,Boyfriend messaging girl from dating app,1dfoccb,Crafty-Maybe-6693,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1dfoccb/boyfriend_messaging_girl_from_dating_app/,"My long distance boyfriend (42m) and I (35f) have been together over a year. Last month he briefly broke up with me (which lasted 3 days). During that time he posted a profile on a dating app, messaged some girls, and one in particular he's continued contact with. They've been hanging out, meeting her friends, etc etc.


A week ago she told him she'd like to be more than friends. He turned her down and they've continued to message platonically. I did not know about any of this until yesterday, when he kept mentioning a ""friend"" but not saying who. I pressed him on it and he admitted how they'd met, and that he intends to continue hanging out with her.


I'm fine with him having female friends, but I feel uncomfortable with how they met, and I feel especially uncomfortable that she expressed interest in a romantic relationship after we'd gotten back together and he didn't tell me. He said we were still rocky and was waiting for the right time to say something, but it's been weeks since we got back together.


I'm not sure how to move forward feeling okay with this. I know I'm feeling extra insecure after he broke up with me in the first place, and immediately hopped on dating apps. How do I reconcile my insecurity and attempts to rebuild trust with this new girl in his life?


TL;DR Boyfriend met a girl during a short break up, she is romantical interested but views her platonically and wants to stay friends with her.",

We have been dating for five years and live together/have a cat/have talked about getting married. I thought things were going well.

Then I noticed he was staying up on his phone lately, and I caved and checked his texts/call log last night. He’s been texting and FaceTiming another girl (who’s in her early 20s) for the past month. By the texts I read, they’ve been on several dates and are very flirty. He met her on a dating app that isn’t on his phone anymore. Last night, he was making plans with her for Sunday.

I’m totally shocked, and heartbroken, and so, so angry. I confronted him when he woke up and he owned up and apologized immediately. He also texted the girl the truth and then blocked her. He said they did not have sex, but admitted they did kiss “a few times”. Most of their dates were during the day. He says he has no feelings for this girl though and that he did it for the validation. (He says he’s been feeling unsure of himself since finishing his graduate program/not being in school anymore. Obviously that’s no excuse, but that was his answer when I asked why he needed more validation.)

He swears it will never happen again, and I want it to work out. I can’t imagine life without him.

How can we move past this?

relationships,Discovered my girlfriend has all the major dating apps on her phone.,17djwch,MembershipWise6964,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/17djwch/discovered_my_girlfriend_has_all_the_major_dating/,"Using a throwaway account to maintain privacy, I (34M) recently discovered that my girlfriend (29F) of three years has been engaging in a rather concerning behavior. It all started when she asked me to unlock her phone to change the music playing on our smart speaker, and I stumbled upon a weird folder containing dating apps, such as Tinder, Bumble, and Hinge. Upon further investigation, I learned that she has been creating fake profiles on these platforms, using photos of women from her Instagram.

After confronting her about this, she initially acted surprised but eventually admitted to what she'd been doing. She explained that she never used her real photo, opting for stock images or pictures of other people. Her rationale for this behavior was even weirder; she claimed it was a source of excitement to match with guys, engage in dirty talk, and fulfill her own desires, only to delete the profiles and repeat the cycle when she felt like it. 

I'm left feeling deeply upset and betrayed by her actions. Her argument that it's not a big deal because these aren't ""real"" profiles and she has no intention of physical cheating doesn't sit well with me. Additionally, I have ethical concerns because she's using other people's photos without their permission.

She has assured me that she would stop, and I watched her delete the apps. However, I'm struggling to trust her now. Am I overreacting, or is this as weird and creepy as it feels to me?

TLDR: I found a folder on my girlfriend's phone that contains all the major dating apps with fake profile photos and now I'm very conflicted and upset.

Edit: the folder wasn't out in the open. I found it because I had to open up her app folder since the smart speaker wasn't responding to the notification bar and as I scrolled I saw the folder which looked weird.",

He watched me delete them. l asked if he still has the apps on his phone, and he said no and that he deleted them a while ago. However, he did not pause his accounts before doing so and said he didn't know you could do that. The convo just went elsewhere because it was late at night and I didn’t think much of it. Should I ask him to go back and do it?

Idk how to approach the convo. We both take criticism well so l'm not worried, but we do long distance so l want this to be done in person. I don't appreciate the fact that his profile is still present on the app even though it's deleted. Should I leave it be? I'd feel a lot better knowing it's paused, because it also feels like there is less of an immediate back up plan in the event that we don't work out. It also feels weird knowing that women are able to see his profile currently if it's being shuffled.

Let me know if this is fair. Ideally, he would delete his account but I haven't even done that so it would be hypocritical.

I confronted her but so far have not wanted to tell her exactly what I found, because I don't know if she's actually been talking to anyone or seeing anyone, so I'm hoping that keeping it open ended would allow for further information.  

Except so far it has backfired on me.  She keeps telling me that I'm making it up in my head, and that she has never done anything to jeopardize our relationship and that  I am just thinking about things too much.  I haven't shown her the actual screenshots I took but told her that I do have actual evidence, I just won't show it.  She thinks I am doing it as a trick to get her.  So instead, she is now telling me that she will break up with me because I don't trust her.  She said we can't have a relationship if there's no trust.

I don't want to break this relationship.  To be honest, my belief is that at one point we had been fighting so bad and perhaps she just went on the app and changed her photos but never talked to anyone seriously.

He asked if I had hidden my profile from the dating app because he could no longer see it and I told him I did because I am enjoying his conversation and sometimes it gets overwhelming when I have too many guys messaging me.

It has been a challenge to meet after that because our lives are busy but we have done a few calls and video calls. We couldn’t meet on the weekend and I got bored so I unhid my profile on the dating app, mainly to block guys that didn’t get the hint I was not interested (apparently they can still message once we had matched) and also just to pass the time.

I didn’t think much of it but he messaged me yesterday asking if he had offended me somehow. I was confused so I asked and he mentioned that he noticed that I unhid my profile and that I must not be that interested anymore.

I guess there was a misunderstanding and I did tell him that I’m still very interested and that I wasn’t aware that a)he wanted to be exclusive and/or b) that he thought I was hiding my profile indefinitely while I was chatting with him. I did apologize profusely for the confusion.

There’s no problem in voicing a concern but the manner in which he approached it is not sitting well with me. Not to mention that he is obviously also active on the dating app so kind of a double standard there.

Now he decided to not message at all this morning, which is not the norm.

I (35 f) feel confused and I don’t feel great. My boyfriend (40 m) always texts me at night and in the morning - and they’re always friendly and loving.

Last night I texted him when I got home (from a dinner with a female friend I had told him about) he didn’t respond for over a half hour and it was a very matter of fact/short response. I then, conversationally, asked what restaurant he went to, again just a short/clipped response, didn’t say who he was there with (he usually does) No follow up text later to say goodnight, no niceties. Odd.

My intuition told me something was weird. In the morning I asked how his night was and who he went with. He names woman I’ve never heard of. I ask where he knows her from, he says he met her years ago on a dating app but they’re just friends and says “I’m not cheating on you, I love you.”  Mind you, all I had said at this point is oh I haven’t heard of this friend.

Long story short, he ends up telling me he felt like I would think it was weird, didn’t want me to feel weird, so purposely didn’t tell me so I wouldn’t feel that way. I.e. he lied by omission. 

I want to believe him, and I guess I believe he didn’t cheat… but it still doesn’t explain his short responses to me. At the end of the day, he was out with a woman late night drinking and made a choice not to tell me.

Also, I know he told me when I asked, but I had to ask more than one clarifying question (he didn’t volunteer that she was from a dating app) and he admitted that he wouldn’t have told me if I didn’t ask. I feel lied to, not a priority , and my feelings are hurt.

Is this a red flag? Do you think it’s indicative that he’s lied about other things and is a cheater?

The rest of the time, he didn't get notifications, and we were okay. I knew at the time we weren't serious yet, so I said just don't do it whilst I'm here, please. We agreed on that. I then flew home on October 8th.

Now, after staying together for 6 weeks, we talked and recently became exclusive around October 15th. I paused all my dating apps and came off them completely. So last night after overthinking, I wanted to check he did too, so i set it to his location and age, and that's when I saw that he still has his account up. 

I also noticed his first picture was of the both of us in times square from when i first met him in January. Only my face is being blocked by an emoji. I don't know what to feel about this part in particular.

What do I do? I know I have to talk to him about this naturally, but I'm not sure how to phrase this. I feel bad for checking, but i wanted to see if my gut was right or at least put my mind at ease. When I looked, it was too late to ask him as he would have been asleep for sure. Since coming home, we've even spoken about me moving there permanently with him and even marrying to get a green card because we love each other and want to make this work.

To clarify,  I wasn't dating him back in January, but we took lots of cute pictures then and recently said he wanted to make this official as he didn't want to lose me. 

Am I overthinking this? Thank you.

Edit - I'm 28 I keep forgetting 😩 ignore thanks haha

TLDR - I found my partner, who I'm currently exclusive with long distance on a dating app using a picture of us together with me blocked out. I'd like opinions please.",
relationships,Is it cheating if I downloaded a dating app and read old conversations? ,1cf0icc,catharley,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1cf0icc/is_it_cheating_if_i_downloaded_a_dating_app_and/,"I’m a 26F and my 28M boyfriend (dating for just over 2 years) saw Hinge on my phone home page while standing behind me. I completely forgot that I had it downloaded and cannot remember when I did. I let him go through the app to confirm that I was not actively using it. 

I confessed that I was reading through old conversations as it was entertaining and reminded myself of how crazy I was when I was younger. I have settled down now and do not go out/drink/party as much as I did back then. I admitted I did miss this part of me sometimes but I am perfectly content with the life I have now. 

He insists this is cheating and that he cannot trust me anymore? Is this the case? If so, is there anyway back from this? How can I make amends?

I would like to reiterate that I have not contacted anyone on the app or ever had any intention to cheat.

We are going on a group trip next week and he says that afterwards we are done as a couple.

Any advice would be appreciated.

She is 36 (F) and I’m 36 (F) we met while she was visiting town in Miami in late April. We are both divorced 

We saw each other for 5 days before she had to fly back to England. We decided to meet in New York a few weeks later for 5 days. We had an incredible time, things went great, we both understand we are on the honeymoon phase and by no way this means how our relationship will go in the future… 

She is coming to Miami in a couple of weeks again. Also, due to her work she can work remote. She has mentioned she wants to move to the East coast and has hinted at moving to Miami. Due to her immigration situation she can only do a few months at a time and no more than 3 months. 

What are you guys thoughts on telling her she is should temporarily move in with me for those 3 months instead of renting her own AirBnb? What would be the best way to present her with this without putting pressure on her? 

Obviously, it’s very early on the relationship but we had deep discussions about what we want for our futures. We are aligned in many things. She has definitely expressed her interest in being closer to me and moving to the US in the future.

Looking at the dating apps, most potential matches don't post any information. What are we to talk about? ""Wow, you can really sit there and look at the camera."" Or, do you just ask the same opening questions?

relationships,I (F25)Found dating apps in husband’s (M29) hidden apps. I looked at his purchase history and they were downloaded during our relationship. How do I take this?,gukuet,ThrowRAdatingapps,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gukuet/i_f25found_dating_apps_in_husbands_m29_hidden/,"I was browsing some things on my husband’s phone. To the point, if you go on your Apple ID account, there’s a spot called hidden purchases. I clicked this and found to my surprise Tinder, Plenty of Fish, and Kik as hidden purchases. I wasn’t freaking out yet, maybe he downloaded them before we were together. So I check his purchase history. Tinder and Plenty of Fish were both downloaded within a few days of each other in 2018.... less than a month after I had given birth to our child. We have a very healthy sex life, but obviously during that time period sex was off the table for a couple of months while I recovered. We still did things though. Just not actual sex.

For some history, I once saw plenty of fish on his App Store with that cloud, redownload button by it. I wasn’t snooping, but did see it, so I had asked him why it had been downloaded. He said he didn’t remember downloading it and it had probably been downloaded before we were together so obviously it would be in his history. I had asked about the date it downloaded and he said that could’ve just been the date he got his new phone and it downloaded from the cloud or something. This was quite a while back. Maybe a year? And that was it. I accepted his answer and chose to trust that he did in fact download before me.

But now I see this. The dates. They’re within a few days of each other so it can’t be some “cloud redownload”... and there’s more than one app.. all during a time we brought our new baby home.. and he took the time to hide purchases.

How am I supposed to take this? I have not confronted or asked his about this yet. I don’t want to be taking things wrong, or not know what I’m talking about in case he makes a stupid excuse. Is there any way this could be innocent? Is there any way the download dates could be inaccurate?

I love him. Sometimes we have our issues as all married couples but we’re fairly solid I thought. This was of course a long time ago... he may not be doing anything now but if he DID..

It looks bad. But I still have the benefit of doubt in my mind because I wonder when he would have had TIME to cheat on me. During that time period, he was working full time, going to school part time, and studying and dealing with me and baby in his spare time.

Did he cheat on me? Is there a way this could be innocent? I don’t know what to think. I don’t know how to approach this. Is there a way to find his specific profile on PoF or Tinder to see if he made an account maybe? 

Tl;dr- I saw in my husbands app history that he downloaded dating apps in 2018, during a time I had just given birth. I am unsure if he was looking to cheat or if there’s any possible way the dates could be wrong. Do I believe him when he inevitably denies it? Or is this clear cut?",

As far as I'm concerned, I'm only being a friend to this woman and nothing is going on so I don't see a problem.

The thing that my fiance is most upset about is the fact that this woman has been calling and texting me about her relationship problems with her ex. My fiance feels that I should be shutting that down because it is as she put it, a slippery slope to cheating. I told her that she's overreacting and needs to get over it because nothing is going on.

I love her and don't want to lose her but I'm also not going to tolerate someone telling me who I can and can't be friends with. I'm not sure how to go about resolving this because as I said, I don't want to lose her but I don't see a problem with what I'm doing.

Edit: I forgot to mention that I did tell my fiance that this was someone that I was interested in potentially dating before I met her. I still don't see a problem because nothing is going on.

after our first month of dating while my boyfriend was on his phone i noticed on the screen a dating app, this wasnt too shocking to me as we met on a dating app ourselves and even tho it made me a little uneasy i knew that we hadnt been together that long and wernt too serious at the time so i forgot about it.
fast forward to last night while we were out these guys came up to us asking us to do that tiktok loyalty test thing were we go through eachothers phones. my boyfriend gave me his phone with no hesitation. and while i looked at the screen i saw that the same dating app was there. i didnt say anything and we continued until the guys left and we joked about how random it was. but im still thinking about why he still has the dating app after 6 months. we are so close and i genuinely love him so much and belive he loves me too, i just dont know how to talk to him about how it makes me uncomfortable.
first off i in no way think that he is cheating or being unfaithfull, but how do i bring up this conversation about the app and calm down my mind. thankyou

I met him in September for the first time and there was an instant click between us and I stayed round his one of the last nights of my holiday and I did catch feelings. He was only a couple months out of a very long term relationship so I knew he wasn’t really ready for anything and 2 weeks after I left we stopped talking.
 
Come the new year he started messaging me again, sending me updates on his farm and we FaceTimed, and eventually I went back to Cornwall in April on a family holiday. The whole week I was there we spent together, and he told me he liked me but wasn’t sure where my head had been at this whole time. Anyway we said we would try and make the effort to see each other and speak more, and so far he’s come to see me a week after I left, we’ve FaceTimed or spoke on the phone probably every other night and I’m going back down to see him in 2 weeks time. 

To me everything has seemed like he was on the same wavelength as me this time and wants to see if things could work as he has been good with FaceTiming and saying things like meeting my friends so etc. 

this was until yesterday, he didn’t reply to me all day so I went on hinge and low and behold he’s made a new hinge profile (which he didn’t have previously). I don’t know how to feel, I messaged asking for a FaceTime and we did and he was acting normal, there was no hints of anything being different. The only thing is he obviously didn’t reply to me all day and then has made a new dating profile.

I don’t know what to do, I really like this guy and I’ve never felt this way about someone before. I’m going down in 2 weeks so how do I bring up where his head is at without coming across intense? It’s a long way and a lot of money for me to go to him so if he isn’t considering anything serious with me I don’t want to spend my time and money visiting him to develop more feelings and getting really badly hurt.

Please help me!! I’m normally an avoidant and would just walk away from this but they say when you know you know and I just feel like we have something between us that I want to explore but I need to know if he feels the same. How do I go about asking this guy when I am in Cornwall what he wants from me?

TL;DR - guy I’m dating made a new dating app profile and I need advice on how to ask him what his feelings are towards me",

I went through pretty major surgery in February ( still recovering from it) and he came to see me at hospital with flowers and my favorite book on Valentine's day which was a turning point for me. I felt he really really cared about me and I let all my guards down and started to give him all the love I possibly could.

Even when I got out of hospital he called me everyday to see how I was doing and spent multiple whole days with me which were filled with nothing other than warmth, care and affection.
I noticed that he was a little defensive in his nature and held his words back while expressing appreciation for me.
He still talked about intention of getting married and such sweet things. He also deleted his dating app in front of me to show me that he doesn't wanna use it anymore and I should do the same.

I agreed and deleted it. One week later , I realized that I forgot to unsubscribe so I should do so and then delete my account once and for all. As I went on the app, wanted to go through our conversation one last time and I noticed his active in last 72 hrs status as yes. All the warm fuzzy feelings and hopes died in that instant for me and I called him later in the evening to come see me.

I confronted him and he swore he doesn't use it to talk to other people and even showed me his app but I didn't go through it. He initially said that he wanted to check if it still has his account and later said that he has this deep rooted insecurity of relationships failing that the app helps him comfort himself. It didn't make sense to me and he went on and on telling me how he feels committed to me and would never do such thing. He then agreed to delete the account but very last minute changed his mind and said to me I don't think I am ready yet and it's so rude of you that you ask me to delete my account and I should trust him that he won't ever use it for eternity and I should forgive him and give him a chance to prove himself. He also says he doesn't mind me keeping my account as he knows that I was gonna delete it anyway.

I don't know what to do as I feel betrayed and feel like everything nice he ever did had ulterior motive behind it. I don't know dating culture in US so can't decide.

TL; DR. Guy I am seeing seemed like a great guy until he reinstalled the dating app that he deleted in front of me and refuse to delete his account.",

I've planned my life around him. We were finally at a place where we could move in together in about 3 months. He's my best friend, or was my best friend. He says he's still in love with me.

Update: I called him today and we broke up. I truly do believe him that he wasn't going to take it further. Maybe he was holding my hand until I was ready to let go, but I really do believe that he didn't want to break up. 

Because I can't let go, I told him that I need to heal and he needs therapy. And maybe after he gets help and gets better and I heal from this, we could try and start from scratch. No promises though. I think the thought that things may not be over for good gave me the strength to break up with him. I'm going to delete him off of snapchat, unfollow him on social media, but keep his number just in case. I love him and I don't want to let him go, but I'm going to for now.",

We live in different countries, so when he mentioned that there’s distance between us, I was like “yea then we can hang out some time as friends right”. And we hung out first in my country, then in his (so 2 times in general), and it was amazing! Endless laughing and talking, since we share lots of common interests. 
Once there was a confusing moment when he asked me “there’s no respect if one of two friends decides to turn things into romantically stuff right?”. I had no idea if he was meaning us or not and just answered “dude everything between friends should be communicated”, then we switched the topic.

The problem’s that I somehow started getting attached to him, although most of our further convos were online and last three were initiated by me. 

Couple of weeks ago I asked while chatting if he would actually go out with me for the second time (back in March) if we started things romantically, i.e. not as friends (I just needed a proof there’s nothing wrong with me after a bad date with someone else).. 

And literally NOTHING was clear in the end cus all he said was that for him it’s the all about the scheme “casual dating->friendship->real dating”, also that he does think about me and asked what do I want out of interacting with him. 
I had nothing to respond other than referring to his own words that “there’s distance between us” and we have only friends option (although inner me I guess wants more than that). 
After that we talked once but  lately we haven’t been texting almost for  2 weeks and I’m wondering if I should really end this weird “friendship” or not :( Earlier chats were like once per 4-5 days.

Now, he isn’t a looker at all, people according to him, have called him ugly to his face; but looks aren’t what are important to me anyway, and we hit it off. 


Over some time, it became clear that he doesn’t view me as particularly attractive. Here are some comments he has slapped me with: 

#1- ( For no reason 1 day he texts me) : “I wish I could Match with someone conventionally attractive/hot on (dating app) I called him out on it & his reply? “Hahaha.” 

#2: Repeatedly comments on my weight (I am short & plump but considered very attractive/pretty by a lot of people, tbh) repeatedly talks about how “I look so lardy” on my old IG pics. Mind you, we haven’t met in person yet, just spoken a LOT.


#3: Not looks related, but he has told me how ambition is a massive turn-on for him in women & “how I am not ambitious at all” for him (I am a student at the age of 30 & in law school & we are both Indians in the UK & Indians generally frown upon doing basic educational requirements so late in life.) 



It’s just.. Repeated comments! About my looks, my weight, and then he will turn around & tell me how funny I am, how smart I am, etc. It just feels like textbook gaslighting at this point & while I really do enjoy his company & our conversation, and I do understand completely how these comments come from his deep-rooted need for validation from Pretty People; I’ve begun to feel unattractive & undesired in front of him. We still talk from time to time but I feel so.. Undesired. I know he doesn’t have to desire me but then, I also feel silly for feeling this way b/c not everyone *has* to find you attractive, you know?

Yesterday, I was using my husband's phone to forward myself an email from his account (he asked me to do so, I wasn't intentionally spying or being sneaky). When I typed my email address, it auto-filled an option for someone he has contacted before. The icon picture was a risque view of some random woman which is what caught my attention. After thinking for an hour or so, I mentioned it to him. When I said the full name that popped up he immediately looked concerned. I have been with this man since I was 15 years old so I know him well enough to feel something was just off. He lied and said it was some random thing he clicked on so now it shows up on his email. I told him the only way something would pop up in his email like that is if he contacted the person. Then his story changed and it was just a harmless message. He never met her so I have nothing to be mad about, no physical contact. He even told me it was on the ""Kik"" app. Maybe he thought offering extra information would help push me along to believing his flaky story. Also claimed he already confessed this to me (laughable). I didn't really talk to him the rest of the evening. I wanted him to know I was mad especially because he tried to brush it off as nothing. I didn't want to have a huge fight about it so before we went to bed I told him my feelings were hurt and that it was a big deal to me. He said he was sorry and again assured me it was ""nothing.""

We have one child together, he is 7 months old. We started trying to conceive in September 2015 which bothers me even more to discover the timing. He has cheated on me in the past but he fessed up to it and I figured we were over that. I trust him but always knew it was naive of me to do so. If I had any feeling he was being unfaithful I would have never married him and absolutely would not choose him as the father of my child.

About that detective work, I found out he created a Cougar Life profile. What the actual fuck? Really . . . Fucking Cougar Life?! What a joke! Seriously, if I weren't so mad I would laugh about it. I found the email chain between him and the woman. What's funny is I think he was duped by fake profile with a sexy picture. Those sites have bots and shit right? Her responses are just strange. He must have found them weird too because I only found the one conversation between them. He initiated the contact. His first message to her reads ""How you doing sexy? Send me # so I can text you rather then email."" Then he asked her for pictures to prove who she was after she replied with some nonsense on why she wouldn't provide her phone number. I feel he would have taken it further had she not acted so fishy.

Now to outline the main reasons I am upset:

1. Dishonesty - From start to finish, he has told so many lies. He truly thinks I'm stupid and he can talk his way out of it. Yeah, it was over a year ago but shit, I still feel betrayed. We were engaged and in an exclusive relationship for a LONG time. He lies so effortlessly too. It worries me how quick he will fib to avoid conflict, small and big things. Nothing happened between him and this woman so the dishonesty is what really hurts the most. And, of course, his intentions when creating the profile in the first place.

2. Time frame - A month before our wedding, the exact month I stopped taking birth control so we could start a family, WTF?! Looking back I don't feel like there were any warning signs that he would be looking to cheat. Everything seemed great. Relationships have ups and downs and I have enough sense to refrain from getting pregnant during a rough patch. 

3. Our son - My husband and I both come from divorced families. I want our son to grow up in a home with his mother and father together. No step-parents or siblings. We have been together so long and have been through so much shit. If we did not have a child, I would probably just be done with it all. At times, he is also verbally/emotionally abusive and I've just about had enough. 

4. Insecurity - 7 months out from giving birth and I am still about 30 pounds away from my pre-pregnancy weight. I feel like shit about myself. Everytime I look in the mirror I am disappointed. None of my clothes fit. His dating profile creation was during a time I felt pretty good about myself which is unsettling. If he wanted to cheat then I'm sure he fantasizes about it now. I feel like a fat, ugly, unappealing housewife. I am currently a stay-at-home mom so I have no income of my own.

Do I have the right to feel just as hurt as if he did this a week ago? Our lives were different when it happened (not yet married, no baby). Yes I know, he didn't technically cheat but he was well on his way to do so. I just feel so awful about the whole situation.

TL;DR: I found out my husband created a dating profile and messaged a woman a month before our wedding which was over a year ago. He lied to me about it. He did not meet her but I am confident he had intentions of doing so. Am I justified to be upset? How should I handle it? We have a 7 month old child together and I am currently an unemployed, full-time mother.

EDIT: Number list, apparently I can't count.

EDIT2: Thank you all so much for taking the time to reply to my post. I apologize I am unable to comment on each of your replies separately. I have a baby to take care of over here. I just don't have the energy necessary to handle such a high stress situation with him right now. I know I have a lot of important decisions to make. Thank you again, everyone. Your words have not fallen on deaf ears.",
relationships,Friends husband messaged me on dating app...do I tell her?,hudjo3,MostlyMorose,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/hudjo3/friends_husband_messaged_me_on_dating_appdo_i/,"TL;DR: Friends husband messaged me on dating app. I let him know I knew him and was blocked. Didn’t tell his wife. 6 months later I see him come up on a coworkers match for same site. Time to tell her?

So this is a sticky situation for sure. I worked with a woman for many years until around 6 years ago. We were close while coworkers but we drifted apart in the years since. I was working with this friend when she started dating her husband. There were issues in the beginning with him still going on dating sites after they were supposed to be exclusive. They were married last fall after being together the last six years. Their wedding was a small gathering and I did not attend but saw all the pics on FB. I had switched stores about six months into the relationship so the husband and I had met but it was only once or twice and very brief. 

Fast forward to January of this year. I received a message on a dating site. When I looked at his profile I knew immediately who he was. The husband. I was curious to see what he would say so I answered back. Of course it didn’t take long for him to start asking inappropriate questions and wanting to exchange photos. I sent him a message asking him if his wife knew he was on that site. I told him he better tell her before I did. He immediately blocked me but I had already taken screenshots of the messages. I went on Facebook and sent him a PM. I told him if he didn’t come clean with his wife I would. I knew who he was, I knew who his wife was and I also knew this exact thing had been an issue from the beginning. The message is still unread. I confided in a family member and a close friend who both said I should basically mind my own business. She knew what he did before, she wasn’t naive about him. Leave it be. To be honest I really struggled with that but in the end I didn’t want to be the one to have to tell her. I feel like....I took the cowards way out. 

Recently, a coworker was on the very same site and guess who was in her matches? We are the same age and on the same site so we sometimes compare who comes up. I didn’t say anything to her other than ‘that one is a creep’. I would like some honest opinions. Is it now time to bring my friend up to speed or once again turn a blind eye?",

relationships,A guy (38M) I (42F) met on a dating app seemed perfect but then I found out he has an abusive past.,1b4o6nf,Donut_Interesting,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1b4o6nf/a_guy_38m_i_42f_met_on_a_dating_app_seemed/,"EDIT/UPDATE: First of all, thank you all for the advice! You’re all so great. :)  I took it and glad I did. I blocked him on social media and immediately got a flurry of messages that clearly indicated he knows A. That I did block him and B. Asking why I ghosted him. He was clearly trying to hide his past but was quick to call me unfair and that he’s “a good guy.”  Blocked. 

(I tried to post this to r/relationship advice but maybe it’s too short? )

I met this really great guy on a dating app and we’ve been chatting nonstop for about a couple weeks. We are now making plans to meet in person and I was super excited about I. 

He is a divorced father of one kid (similar to myself). We have a ton in common and everything I could find on his fb profile indicated he was nothing short of a wonderful and caring father and very loving to his ex. He seems to have a lot of friends and support in his life, he is very successful in his career, is extremely dedicated to his child and just overall seems wonderful. He has been very respectful of me and kind and I’ve only seen green flags. 

We were up all night talking last night and I was getting really excited to meet him and get to know him in person. 

This morning I realized that I hadn’t caught his last name yet. He has his first name on fb but not a full name and suddenly I grew slightly concerned. (It’s not uncommon for people not to put their full names on fb, but something about it made me want to do more digging). I dove deep in his history, located his ex and was able to find his last name. One search brought up a page indicating some pretty intense stalking of his ex wife, psychological and physical abuse “while intoxicated.” No formal charges were brought on him but she was granted a restraining order against him. 

Here is where the advice is needed: he no longer drinks he said. He’s gotten very fit and healthy over the past year and perhaps he’s turned things around from that time but I just don’t like the idea of continuing on with someone who has the potential to be physically violent. I blocked him on socials just because I got nervous about the stalking aspect of the case. I know he’s going to text me soon and probably wonder why. What is the best way to go about ending things delicately? Is it worth bringing up the real reason? Do I just block his number and move on? Is that even helpful to someone? I don’t want to throw his past in his face but I also think it’s important to be straightforward about it but I don’t know if it’s even worth it. What’s another excuse I could use to end it?

 Again, perhaps he’s changed and this is something in his past but for me it’s just not worth the risk. Is that too harsh? Unfortunately I get the feeling was not a one time “mistake” but a pattern of bad behavior that led to this so it’s hard to overlook it and continue talking to him anyway. I just don’t know how to suddenly do a 180 and cut things off. 

Thanks in advance for the advice!

TLDR: Guy I’m supposed to meet has an abusive past. How to break things off gently via text without being obvious",
relationships,"I (28F) have feelings for my friend (30M) I met on a dating app last year, and I think he might feel the same but I’m unsure. Need some input!",nvt60e,senditspeedy,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/nvt60e/i_28f_have_feelings_for_my_friend_30m_i_met_on_a/,"April of 2020 I matched with Adam on a dating app. We met, it went really well! Adam and I had a ton in common, got along great, and seemed to have good chemistry. He paid for everything on the date despite my offers, and we discussed future hangouts. He made no physical moves, however - we just shared a nice hug at the end. Adam is more of a nerdy, awkwardish fella - I love that about him, but I did wonder if the lack of a move was due to this or a lack of interest in me.

I am conventionally attractive in most ways, and I am a healthy athlete, but two things I will openly admit:

1. I have always felt less feminine because I am very fit, and “larger” despite having a flat stomach and very womanly features, as I am not thin/small. Further because I am interested in very male dominated hobbies, I assume most men see me as “one of the guys”.
2. Counterintuitive to my last sentiment but still how I feel, but because I have big boobs/butt/hips, and a lot of career success, I often attract very “aggressive” men...overly macho in their pursuit if you will. This is not my type *at all* but now I feel unless it is BLATANTLY OBVIOUS - there’s no way a guy is into me. This makes it harder if a guy is shy or a little awkward, which is much more my type. A fine conundrum I have on my hands here.

Adam and I hung out again and once again - lovely time, ended on a hug. I offered to split expenses and once again he pays.

Then COVID hit, shit got intense, I didn’t have the space to see him for a few months.

We meet up again, same thing - he pays, nice time is had. I feel like he seems attracted to me maybe, there is definitely chemistry...but he’s shyish and I’m afraid to assume he thinks I’m cute.

Fast forward to end-ish of last year. We meet up for drinks, and at one point in the conversation he starts steering it in a way I can’t really see where it’s going, complimenting me on how well I’m doing in life. He then paused and looked me in the eyes and said “I just feel very fortunate and lucky to know you”. I grabbed his hands and thanked him and told him how much that meant to me. We part ways, but I am very rushed this time as I almost missed the last train home.

Now we are both avid climbers (most of our dates/hangouts have involved this) and had talked a lot about going on a climbing trips many times. A few weeks later he asks if I’d want to finally go, and he planned a beautiful two night, three day trip. Booked bed and breakfasts, found the spots, etc. I figured this is when I would know! Aaaaaaaaand then a storm and flash flood hit the area and we couldn’t go - BOO! Instead we just did a little local climb to catch up, not bad but the weather was cold and we kept it short.

He made a few attempts to hangout with me but I had been SLAMMED with a new job.

I’ve had more time recently, so we’ve been spending more time together recently. This is where things get a little complicated and I’m starting to think maybe there are feelings here.

The last time we hung out I asked about his love life, he mentioned one casual partner he was ending things with and that he is very single. I emphasized I was as well.

Long story short, we were having a LOVELY time, and went off to go climbing. A little flirtation seems to be happening - I mention that he’s giving me a wild look in his eyes, he winked. Very cute...I was so excited until, things went awry. I’ll save the details, but I ended up getting in a fairly serious climbing accident that day. It was nobody’s fault and a mechanical failure.

This could have scared the shit out if anyone. It happened out of nowhere and could have killed me had things gone any differently. I was covered in blood and extremely concussed. (FYI I’m ok now but do have a few months of recovery from one injury, but I’ll be a-ok and if could have been a LOT worse).

Adam handled it in stride. He cleaned me up as best he could and immediately took me to the emergency room. He held my hand through getting sutures, made sure I was well taken care of, etc. Around 3am I told him to go back to my apartment to sleep. He did, I get home around 6 and he slept a bit longer and then got up to go home/to work. He did not attempt to cuddle me or anything of that nature while we were in bed together, could have been from stress - could be because he didn’t want too.

He messaged me after seeing my Instagram story a few days later telling me my stitches suit me and that he’ll see me soon.

Last week we made plans to have dinner at my place when he gets back from a work trip. I also mentioned a climbing event I was going to this last weekend. He said he’d love to possibly meet up for lunch there, so we did. He met two of my best friends and everyone got along great.

Tonight we’re cooking dinner and drinking wine together. I feel like this is an intimate enough setting to where I need to figure this out. This will be about our 10th time hanging out or so.

So Reddit - is this dude into me and just a bit more shy, or do I just have a great friend and I’m hoping for something that won’t happen? HELP!

TL;DR I met a guy on a dating app about a year ago. We have a great time together whenever we hangout, share a few mutual friends now, do a lot of things together one on one, he planned an entire trip for us (got rained out), and he has complimented me plenty and says he feels fortunate to know me. But has never made a move. Unsure if just friends, or if he might have feelings for me. I certainly have a crush on him! But what do I do now?

Update: “you know I’ve held you in high regard...I’ve had a big crush on you for a long time”

“Awww thanks, you’re always so nice to me”

Also my sister died today.

I feel like I’m not supposed to love or care about anything.",
relationships,My (28F) BF (29M) seeks “external validation” through dating apps,16sovr5,OfficeMouse250,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/16sovr5/my_28f_bf_29m_seeks_external_validation_through/,"TDLR: TWICE in the 2.5 years I’ve been with my BF I’ve found out he had been on dating apps seeking external validation from other women. He claims it’s nothing but has met up with some before and flirted with others on the app. He claims I’m making it a bigger deal than it is and he only did it because he  just wants to “meet new people to befriend/talk to”. I’m hurt and not exactly sure how to go from here.

My BF and I have been together for 2.5 years and have lived together for 1 year already. 7 months into our relationship I found texts he had with another girl that he had been casually talking to nearly every day for over a month, there was also texts that confirmed they met up in person while I was at work. When confronted about this my BF claimed it was a girl he matched with on a dating app before we got together and she randomly texted him. He said that he enjoyed talking to her because he felt emotionally disconnected from me because I was working A LOT at the time in a very stressful job. He said nothing happened physically between them it was solely talking. I was extremely hurt because I thought we were in a good place, but I told him I was able to move past it if he was 100% truthful and told me everything that happened. He said that was all there was to it. Fast forward a month, him and my roommate at the time got into a huge fight and my roommate confessed to me that when she first met us she recognized my BF from a dating app. She thought maybe it was an old profile, but then her friend stumbled on his profile again and saw it was active (he even had pictures with MY dog on there). When I confronted him about this, he said he was feeling insecure and was looking for external validation, but said he wasn’t doing that because he wanted to leave me. We broke up for a few weeks because again, I was extremely hurt, and my trust was shattered. He did a lot in those weeks to prove how much he loved me and couldn’t bear to lose me. We eventually got back together, and I told him it would take a long time for my trust to become stable again, and eventually it did, with the occasionally snoop through his phone if I was feeling insecure. Fast forward to last night: I asked him if I could see his phone and he said “sure I have nothing to hide” so I looked at it as a test to see if he would act suspicious. To my surprise, I found this app called BOO on there. He had a full-blown profile and messages from other women, one message from him saying “it’s a shame you’re on the other side of the world from me” or something like that… I immediately put his phone down and went on mine to google wtf this app was (I had never heard about it) and saw people mainly used it for dating, but that it can be used for socializing too. 20 minutes later I confronted him about it and he got upset, saying that he felt violated, even though I had asked if I could see his phone. He claimed he heard about it on Twitter and recently downloaded the app, and that he was using it to meet new people around the world. He pulled his phone out again to show me and it had been clearly tweaked because the messages I saw were gone. But I was able to press a button and recover them, and he didn’t see anything wrong with them, or all the “hearts” and friend requests he sent to other women. We decided not to talk about it and he walked away and I tried to go to bed for the night, but I feel the same level of hurt I did the last time something like this happened. I can’t help but think he would’ve never told me about it and would’ve kept it hidden. In the time we’ve been together we’ve gone through a lot emotionally but worked so hard at our relationship to continue to show out for one another. I feel like he’s seeking external validation again because we’re lacking in some way... But, I don’t know how to go about it, even if it wasn’t the extent it was last time, I can’t help but feel like it could’ve been if I didn’t catch him early on. We also now live together, and our lives are closely intertwined. Should we seek couples counseling? Any advice is welcomed, I need it.",
relationships,Is a dating app considered cheating?,lmegih,ogmeatball23,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/lmegih/is_a_dating_app_considered_cheating/,"I (18F) found my year long boyfriend(18M) on a dating app called Bumble, and there were hundreds of conversations between him and other girls. However, in every conversation I saw, his flirts were the absolute most vanilla it can get(not calling them cute, pretty, asking to meet up, etc.) and the conversations didn't last more than a few messages. 

Anyways, it became a huge problem for me since I have been cheated on in the past, and it hurt me just as bad. I also should add that he cheated on his ex girlfriend before me, but told me that it was only because he didn't have strong feelings for her(I would consider myself different because I took his virginity).

 I confronted him on it and he told me he did it with his friends as a ""joke"" and a ""pastime"". He apologized, saying he didn't realize how much it would upset me. Fast forward, and I am slowly working on moving past it, and we are having a conversation about it. 

He says that he still does not consider his actions as cheating. But why do I feel like I've been cheated on? Would you consider this cheating?

TL;DR My boyfriend doesn't consider being on a dating app as cheating.",

My wig is extremely natural looking, made of expensive human hair. I know I look good with the wig, but I'm unsure if the fact that I wear it is something I should be up front with straight away. It's not like I'm completely bald underneath, I just wasn't blessed with good hair and enjoy wearing my wig.

I (F18) have been dating my boyfriend (M18) for about 9 months now. About a month ago me and him were on a short break. A few days ago I found out that during this break, he downloaded a dating app. Since me and him got back together, he's repeatedly deleted and downloaded the app. He's been talking to people on it- nothing in depth, just very surface level compliments and small talk. He told me he did this because he feels like I'm not attracted to him and he wanted the validation of getting compliments. He's a pretty insecure person, but I've never seen that as a red flag or something to be concerned about. I always thought that it was just insecurity, and not a need for constant validation. I broke up with him on the spot. He was very apologetic and told me he had wanted to tell me but didn't want to hurt me. I don't know how true that is seeing as he had texted multiple girls that same day. I was very confident that I made the right decision by breaking up with him, but when I talked to my dad about it, he kind of said that it wasn't a big deal, so now I'm not sure. He never met up with any of these girls, and I genuinely don't think he had any malicious intent. I think he just has issues. I really care about him and I want our relationship to work. Have I overreacted by breaking up with him? Is what he did considered cheating? Should I help him work through whatever issues he's having?

The first month of us being together we followed each others instagram but then I stumbled upon another instagram account of his with another girl in his profile picture and the girls name was in his bio I thought that was odd and he wasn’t suspicious yet but it looked like an old account, so I decided not to bring it up and to just assume it’s an old account he no longer has access to. A few months go by I notice he changed his profile pic in that old account and he took the girl off his bio, so I grew curious on what is on this account I made a secret account and I request to follow him he accepted there was nothing suspicious on it but I just thought it was weird how it took him a while to change it. I notice he follows the girl in the picture, I wanted to bring it up but had a hard time so I never brought it up until recently. We had a little argument and I confronted him and asked him why does he have two instagram account and who is the girl in the picture. He claims he forgot abt the account and didn’t have access to it for a while and when he did he decided to change the picture and take her off the bio and that he now doesn’t have access to it. I asked him why didn’t he choose to follow me in that account, his response is that he was barely on it and I just don’t believe him. So I decided to redownload the dating app we met on just to see if he was active on it. The account he used that we met on still existed but when I went to swiping another profile with his pictures showed up and his bio and prompts had so many details about himself like his pets, best friend, three languages he speaks, his family,his height, career and town. This is where I texted him a screen shot of his profile and decided to confront him head on he denied and claimed that someone is pretending to be him and he sent me a screen recording on how the app isn’t even downloaded on his phone he kept telling me he loves me so much and“you’re  the most perfect woman why would i do that” . I was still skeptical but he kept trying to convince me that was not him and that he loves me. I still don’t feel like I can trust him and that he is cheating or hiding something from me. I made a dating profile account using one of my friends pictures with her permission (he doesn’t know of her or has met her) and we matched we’ve been texting on the dating app for a day and I am 99% sure that it is him by the way he texts, the timing between his text messages to me and the dating profile and every details he says about himself is too accurate for someone that is pretending to be him. I am stuck with that 1% what if he’s telling me the truth and someone has hacked him. He’s asked my fake dating profile on a date. Should I go find out if it’s really him and surprise him? Or should I just break up with him? 


TL;DR: Met boyfriend on a dating app, discovered a mysterious second Instagram with an old photo of him and a girl, confronted him months later, he claimed he forgot about it and has no access to it. Recently found a dating profile using his details, he denies it's him. I made a fake dating profile and matched with him but I'm considering surprising him on a date to find out the truth or breaking up with him.",

Initially, she was unable to spend as much time together because of a very stressful situation at work and I was patient and understanding. So, it took us a while to get physically and emotionally intimate. I was having severe insecurities because of how long we would go without seeing each other but I stuck with it because she seemed to genuinely want to see me whenever her schedule allowed.

&#x200B;

Those insecurities culminated in a pretty shitty sexual experience the first couple of times we had tried to have sex. I wasn't able to perform and got in my own head about things. What gave me hope was that she was incredibly patient and understanding in return. We kept hanging out and she would do little things that showed me that she really cared for me and on my birthday, while at dinner, we had a conversation about becoming exclusive. Both of us said we weren't ready to call it a committed relationship but that we didn't want to date others

&#x200B;

About a month ago we both talked about how sex was an important aspect of any relationship and we had to find a resolution. She didn't quite give me an ultimatum but she did say it was important to her. I had been working with a therapist and put in a lot of effort into making sure I could address the situation. We had many plans over the winter holidays and I was prepared but she fell really ill and things kept getting postponed. 

&#x200B;

Finally, after several weeks, we had sex this past weekend and it was amazing. Both of us were quite happy and I was thrilled that we were finally making progress. However, when I was leaving her place, she looked at her phone and I inadvertently glanced over as I was putting on my shoes and noticed that she had a couple of notifications from a dating app. It absolute crushed me and for the past three days, it's just been playing in my head. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt and thought that maybe she never deleted the app. Today, I couldn't handle it anymore and I created a profile on the app and long behold, I found her profile was still active.

&#x200B;

I'm not sure where to go from here because I am terrified of this relationship ending since I like her so much. But, clearly, I also cannot trust her and not sure if I should just end it for my own protection and sanity.

&#x200B;

TL;DR -- 30 M dating a 29 F for 4 months, we have had some issues but she is still showing interest. We talked about being exclusive 6 weeks ago and I found her on a dating app this week. What do I do?",

But the idea of getting a boyfriend from a dating app is horrible to me. I just feel like it’s the least romantic way possible. It doesn’t feel “meant to be” at all, and if I’m going to have a boyfriend, it’s got to be “meant to be.” Meeting on an app is so unromantic and I can’t take the apps seriously. At this point it’s not something I’m ready to compromise on, as stupid as that sounds. (Yes, I read a lot of books and watched a lot of movies as a kid lol.)

Obviously I have nothing against the actual people who found SOs on dating apps; I’m jealous, I wish I could let myself. But I just hate that idea. How do I get over this stupid preconception? Everyone keeps telling me “there’s nothing wrong with the apps” but I hate them…but then it seems impossible to meet someone irl.

tl;dr: I only want to meet a boyfriend irl but it doesn’t seem possible, so I want to know how to start accepting dating apps.",
relationships,Found out the person (28M) that I (24F) have been dating for 13 weeks is on a new dating app.,lfd7do,avocadomed,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/lfd7do/found_out_the_person_28m_that_i_24f_have_been/,"We never agreed upon exclusivity, I’ve been focused on so many other aspects of my life that I just naturally cut all other connections off around 8 weeks. I understand that was entirely my decision and I don’t expect him to do the same. When we do go out or spend time together, (11 dates so far) it’s so incredible and I really feel such a strong connection there. He does like me and care about me, however we don’t text at all in between dates and he’s been so much more distant lately. However, we both agree that our connection has evolved into something past physical lust and superficial emotions. We’ve gotten to a point of emotional intimacy that I’ve only ever gotten to with one ex-LTR partner in the past and we spend weekends at a time together, reveling in each other’s company and enjoying the moment.

Ever since I discovered he was actively talking to new people on a dating app last week, I’ve felt so unsure about where I stand with him. I am going to resolve this by reaching out and communicating how I’m feeling with him and going forward from there. I’ve been the one who’s been having to reach out first lately (although he is very excited when I do) so we’ve been in a communication drought for about 8 days now because I was really in my head about being the one to reach out first again. We do formally date and we both acknowledge that we’ve been dating each other since October 2020. My biggest issue now is that I’ve grown attached to him and am now in the process of cutting my losses in the case that he wants to move on BEFORE I even reach out to him to speak on this issue. Am I acting too impulsively with that attitude?

TL;DR - He’s been distant yet our connection has been evolving into something very intimate. The fact that he’s on a dating app now doesn’t sit well with me and as a result I’m slowly pulling away. Should I just cut my losses or should I wait to talk to him about exclusivity? I’m very confused about what to do to move forward.",

I now found out he has been doing this for 1.5 years, we have been dating for 3. He says he didn’t use them the whole time just periodically and for no longer than 4 days each time. When I asked him why all he could say was that he wanted to know if he was attractive to other girls and that he could never picture our relationship going as long as it has. He also mentioned he did it just in case we ever broke up, so that he could have something to fall back on. He has apologized and hasn’t been on the apps for 3 months. I obviously know this is wrong of him and I have expressed how this has made me insecure and hurt. I don’t know what to do now, he keeps saying that he loves me and wants to be with me but I don’t trust him. Stupidly I still love and care for him deeply as he is my best friend.

I (26F) met my husband 6 years ago in University we’ve been officially together since then and had what I would call a perfectly imperfect relationship. We loved each other and went through so much before we can finally get married 2 years ago. We had our ups and downs, we broke up multiple time when we were dating but always got back together. I found out few days ago that we used to be on dating apps when we were still together but in different places or states. 

When I first asked him he denied then after I showed everything I found out he admitted but doesn’t remember exactly why and how it happened. He’s saying he probably did it out of frustration when we were fighting or something.. I didn’t find anything else since we got engaged or married.. but I’m not sure how I can trust him again. He’s saying he was stupid and he changed and he would never do it again.. 

I don’t know what to do anymore, for him we started a new page ever since we got married and I should blame him if it happened while we’re married. But for me even though this was 3 years ago, this is cheating and if he allowed himself to do it before he would do it anytime again. My trust in him is shattered and I don’t see myself trusting him ever again… 
What should I do ? What would you do if you were me ?

We had originally started talking and set the understanding that we both wanted something that grew from a friendship to a relationship. For me this was perfect cause I’ve had to many relationships that moved to quick and burned out fast.

We started meeting for coffee and seeing each other 1 time a week for a year and at this point she invited me to her church so from that point we see each other at least 3 times a week. This progressed to me being invited to family cook outs and her families birthday party’s and I’ve gotten to know her family pretty well.

February of this year on Valentine’s Day I talked about how we originally met and where were we in terms of a relationship (at this point it has been a total of 2 years) she said she wasn’t ready for a relationship. I told her I understand and made sure we were still working towards one which she confirmed. 

In June 3 weeks before an  operation I told her I have grown feelings for her and I understand if she is not ready but I wanted her to know how I feel. I didn’t hear from her for about 5hrs and I get a response saying she only wants me as a friend. 

This devastated me and threw me into a depression that almost caused me to cancel this life changing operation. I took a few weeks of not really talking to her outside of 1 word responses. Till I finally just told her how that hurt me and that we invested years into this. She said that it’s not just me she has decided she never wants a relationship (to be clear she has never had a date or a boyfriend with anyone before she met me) this made me feel a little better (I don’t know why).

So it’s been a couple months since then and this is current and we have been hanging out like we usually do but I’m not happy with it. I’m not happy with only being friends and part of me wants to stop seeing her/ talking to her and the rest of me feels like I want to hold out hope that she might change her mind and can’t imagine her not being in my life. Every time she introduces me as her friend I feel hurt all over again. Idk how to just be friends with her I don’t know if I can. 

Any advice would be appreciated:
Should I stick it out and be her friend?
Should I stop if it’s hurting me regardless of how it effects her?
Should I give it more time and hope I can change her mind?


Some additional info about her:
Growing up she wasn’t allowed to hangout with people. Her parents were extremely strict so she didn’t have many friends growing up and wasn’t allowed to visit them cause if they had a brother her parents told her she would be R******. She confided in me this caused her to get thrown in depression and have to learn to live without friendship and companionship.

We have been talking for about 2.5 months. We will have been seeing each other for two months in one week (which is when I plan to talk about becoming exclusive).

We haven't had a discussion about being exclusive, but I feel like we are. This weekend I went over Saturday night, stayed the night Saturday, stayed until late morning Sunday, and then saw him again for the Mario movie Sunday night.

I sent a text saying I made it home safely, thanking him for a great weekend, that I had fantastic time, one sentence summarizing what we did this weekend, that the best part was getting to spend time with him, and said to sleep well, goodnight, and that I would talk to him later.

Anyway, I wanted to check the date of the day we met each other, which I could do through our conversation on Facebook Dating. We have since moved off the app and have each other's numbers. While scrolling through the messages, I must have accidently tapped on a message twice and it liked it. I un-liked it as quickly as possible.

For a little over a month, he has been replying to my ""made it back safely"" text messages. So I just found it odd that he didn't reply to this one and worried that he saw the ""like"" notification from our Facebook Dating conversation that hasn't been used in over a month and now thinks I was on Facebook Dating even after all the time we spent to together this weekend!

relationships,My gf confessed she used a dating app while we're still together. I dumped her but she wants us back,wc6eug,potatoiphone,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/wc6eug/my_gf_confessed_she_used_a_dating_app_while_were/,"Im \[30m\] and GF \[23f\]. We're dating on and off for 3 years and just recently became official for I think 6 months. For the past couple of months, Ive been noticing some of her actions that gave me something to worry about, like when we're together she's still using her phone to chat or if there's a notification popup and im right beside her, before she opens it she will set to lowest brightness (maybe she's hiding something?). She always assures me that shes loyal and I should stop overthinking.

Last month, we had a big fight and she (a little drunk) confessed she wanted to come clean that she used a dating app before and been talking to 3 guys. She said no need to worry she already blocked all of them after maybe 1month of chatting. I think the confession has been watered down and in my mind she did much worse.

What hurts me the most was the timing of the act, it happened during the month we became official. For me it is unacceptable because I suppose you both are still in honeymoon phase and cheating is the last thing on your mind.

Now she's begging me to come back. I haven't replied to her message  nor contacted her in 3weeks. I already let her know that we're done and I made the decision to move on. But everytime she sends me a message I'm softening up because I still love her. I'm very close to getting back with her but I fear that what happened really destroyed my trust or the way I look at her. If we ever got back together, I think every move I will be paranoid and think she's cheating. I still think moving on is the best decision for both of us.

TLDR: She used a dating app during our fist month. She came clean but should I forgive her?

Let me know your thoughts. Thanks!",
relationships,"Got into argument and downloaded dating app, now...",e9f27h,OpenComedian,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/e9f27h/got_into_argument_and_downloaded_dating_app_now/,"I'm kind of upset and lost and stumbled upon here and made an account to see what you guys think and get some advice, so strap yourselves in for a long story I'll try make it interesting.

On Saturday, me and my girlfriend went out with her friend and her boyfriend and we had fun, we had a great time and I enjoyed it, however when we went back into the car she was quite upset, and mostly because she said I didn't show affection and it didn't seem like we were in a relationship; she normally gets a little angry when we fight and threatened not to hang out over our Christmas break and the way she brought it up was ""You don't never hold my hands, you don't love me, I never wanted you to meet my friends because I thought we wouldn't work out"". This got out of hand and the past got brought up and needless to say we were both angry and ended up sleeping angry. The next morning she was nicer, however I mentioned that I didn't appreciate how she compared me with her friends boyfriend and said things that I didn't love her - and things spiraled out of control there.

Now, I can understand some of her frustrations so to get a better understanding I have a hobby similar to dancing and it gets quite intimate with my dance partner, however I had offered to quit the hobby and was in the process of doing so. This came up and she accused me of cheating and seeing other girls and had previously accused me of cheating multiple times in arguments in the past. None of this were true however I understood where her insecurities were coming from, so I had let her check my phone multiple times over the course of our relationship and she made me block a few female friends. There were times where she made me message female friends and watched me message them to make sure nothing was going on and made me ask certain questions. We also had an argument previously about 6 months ago where I forgave her for meeting with someone who slid in her IG dms and she subsequently went to the gym with (she ended up having herpes and a yeast infection a week afterwards although she is adamant that she did nothing with the guy). I forgave her and took her word for it and we moved on.

Back to the argument, she ended up going home and packed all her things from my room and essentially made it out that we were broken up. When she left I felt quite down and downloaded a dating app, which was stupid on my part however felt like it was a way to take my mind of things (yes stupid), although it seemed like a good idea at the time. I swiped on a bunch of girls and talked to two of them, none of which I flirted with - the conversations were about jobs, and life, maybe a bit about hobbies, not spanning more than 10 messages each and I had ignored a bunch of other messages too. (Yes I know this still doesn't excuse it)

The next day at work, we had talked and somehow she realized that she over reacted and it was not fair to compare me with her friends boyfriend so we made up, however I never told her I got the application, although she mentioned she wanted to talk to me, and asked me a few questions like ""would you think it's acceptable to go to a club after an argument"" so I figured she knew.

After work we met up, and had dinner, then she asked me about the app - I told her that I did use it, and I gave her my reasons and said that I'd let her check my phone and messages and I also said something along the lines of ""when you keep accusing me of cheating every week and say things like I don't love you as much anymore it drives me away"" and expressed that I want to know that she loves me, and not to argue every weekend. I gave her my phone to check the messages and she didn't seem to bothered by them however I practically tried to justify what I did which as you can imagine inflamed the situation more and tried to drive a point home about how she treats me which angered her further, I did say I have no problem deleting the app and apologized for using it, and I knew it was unfair for her and a stupid move on my behalf. She asked to be dropped home and that we were done and she swears that she would never see me again, and so I dropped her home, and tried talking to her although she stormed out of the car. That night a few hours later a friend told me they found her on bumble.

I tried talking to her about it and apologizing for going on the dating app, and I told her that I understand what I did was wrong and I'm happy to do whatever it takes to fix the damage I have done however she has been seeing the messages and not responding. At this point I'm not sure what to do, and I'm not angry at her for going on Bumble, it does hurt though since she practically said what I did was wrong and I admitted it too and it seems a bit different though since she had swore we're broken up, and I understand that she's effectively single, although the intent for usage seems rather different and to be quite honest I'm actually not sure what to think or how I even feel about this relationship in a whole with the trust issues and I felt a bit controlled. I do know that I love her? and I do want to be with her. What do you guys think about the relationship or what should I do? A big part of me wants to work out it and a small part of me is sort of happy/relieved that the relationship has ended as we had constant arguments and I was constantly accused and told what I could and couldn't do.

\- Girlfriend met a guy through IG dms 6 months ago

\- I do dance hobby which during shows appears intimate with another partner however quitting since GF not happy

I downloaded tinder made a fake profile fake name and fake pictures and did it. Let me be clear, my intention was to never meet someone or talk to anyone or match with anyone.

first thanks a lot for dedicating your time for reading this.

I broke up with my girlfriend last week (3 years of relationship). At the beginning I thought that I want to take a break from relationships for a year or half a year. However, after a week I started to feel lonely, emptiness.

Thus,  I have decided to download a dating app. Here comes the problem, on the one hand  I feel immoral, meaning I feel that by downloading a dating app right after a break up is immoral, unethical, but on the other hand I also feel the urge to disengage from the loneliness feeling. I am clueless of what to do.

what is your advice? do you also think that it is immoral? or legitimate?

Thanks a lot for reading this I really appreciate it.

TL;DR

On one hand I feel immoral for downloading a dating app right after the break up, but on the other hand I feel the urge to disengage from the loneliness feeling.",

So I (20/M) met this girl(18/F) on a dating app about a month ago and we started talking and everything was great we would snap non stop, talk about each other’s days and actually care how our days were, we would speak on the phone for hours and she would call me whenever she was drunk and would call me randomly at times to chat just to me, she was genuinely curious about me and wanted to know more about me and vice versa, we would talk about loads of deep topics and generally I started to get feelings for her and it felt like we were in a relationship already just from the way we spoke and how much we spoken, it’s as if we were dating but unofficially.

So we decided to meet up a few days ago after roughly snapping and calling each other for 3 weeks, and we did, we went to a nice place to chill and spoke to for hours and then after that I walked her home and went back home. But after we met up she basically friendzoned me and said she just sees me as a friend. 

So I’m just confused as too why this happened and my self esteem has plummeted from this because I was the same in person as I was on the phone to her, and she already knew how I looked like cuz we spoke on Snapchat so what could’ve been so awful about me in person that made her want to friendzone me? This has been on my mind a lot since then and it makes me really hopeless in finding love. 

Also this is my first time posting something on a subreddit so I apologise if my formatting is bad.",
relationships,"I [24F] have trouble with online dating because I need the connection to happen ""organically"". Is there any way to change my mindset and do people even date outside of apps nowadays?",8tilcd,stupidissues,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8tilcd/i_24f_have_trouble_with_online_dating_because_i/,"I've been single for a year and fully ready to mingle. Not necessarily looking for a new relationship but I wouldn't be opposed to it if it happened. However, I'd love to casually date, hell just get laid, get some excitement into my life. 

I get crushes super easily on someone i interact with regularly, like coworkers. I enjoy going with the chemistry, like talking to a guy at a party, i get into it. Used to have, and enjoy, one night stands earlier. 

However, I have huge trouble with online dating or online hook up. An idea of matching based on a few lines and pictures, having loaded conversations, and then meeting for the first time with express purpose of scoping each other out... it's just weirding me out for some fucking reason. Like, in theory i am super open to it, hell I am super open to \*anything\*. In practice, though, I have a date scheduled with a dude from Tinder in a few days, a perfectly lovely dude, and all I feel is dread and annoynce that I have to continue interacting with him and then go on that date (and I've matched and met up with a lot of people, so it's not like we just don't have the spark with this particular guy). 

The problem is, it doesn't seem like there are ways to get dates outside of apps. I don't want to get involved with coworkers in any ways for obvious reasons. My friends don't have any single friends I could be interested in, nor are they throwing any big parties these days. I don't really have any hobbies that lend themselves to large groups of people, and again joining some group or meet up for the subject I am not interested in just to scope out potential mate seems... weird AF. All of my friends that are taken are either with someone they met still in uni, or with someone they met through an app. 

I do have a couple of ""talented"" female friends who get hook ups, dates and boyfriend contenders just by flirting with people at coffeeshops, queues or at the notary's office, but no matter how hard I try, I can't seem to acquire this skill (wouldn't honestly say those friends are prettier than me, either). I am unwilling to go to a bar alone after seeing what can happen even to the most careful women due to my job, but when I'm there with my friends I don't feel right ditching them to approach a dude, and we never get approached anymore either (all my male friends say they stopped approaching women in clubs and bars and whatever in favour of Tinder). 

Basically my question is twofold: how do I get with the times and start enjoying online hookups/dating, and are there any way people still meet and like someone outside of apps? 

Tl;DR: am single woman looking for anything from hookups to dating. Really really don't enjoy app dating because all i feel is weirded out / uninterested when it comes to purposely meeting someone for the first time with express romantic/sexual purposes. Is there a way to change my attitude and do people still organically meet others? ",

I confronted him about it today and he said he admitted he didn't tell me the truth. He said it's because I started to bleed during sex and it scared him. Another reason is he didn't want to present a GF to his parents in XMAS because he had just gotten out of a 1yr6mos relationship a month before we met and he thought he should do it if he had a GF so he felt bad and just decided to break up with me. He said he was on tinder only to try and find a ""casual gf"" and that he told the girl he currently has a GF but was doubting it(he was very scared with bleeding during sex). He reached out to me JANUARY 10 and we got back together. He never mentioned any of it. 

The way he handled the confrontation made me uneasy somehow. He asked me for forgiveness and admitted his mistakes. He promised he would never do it again. 

He asked me to just feel okay because he feels worried and nervous that I'm mad. He asked me to feel okay so he can be okay and continue studying. I asked him if he wants me to be okay for him and he flatly said yes. So that he could feel better. I understand that part but it's kinda fucked up. We talked more and I ended up pretending everything is fine and then he asked if we could go to sleep because he is tired. He realized I was still not okay and he started cussing then continued to say things to make me feel better. He said he doesn't wanna have sex because he is stressed with masters but started to touch me because he thinks it's going to be okay once we fuck.

Please tell me this is not how a normal relationship is? This is my 1st relationship as an adult. I was single for 9years. How do I forgive him?

TL;DR: Basically the title. Today I found out he used a dating app on Dec 14, 2022. A week before he broke up with me. How do I forgive him?

relationships,"Widower concerned about GF's ""friend"" that she met on a dating app",ymm0yu,NoExplanation2947,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ymm0yu/widower_concerned_about_gfs_friend_that_she_met/,"TLDR: Saw some chats from my GF's friend who she met on a dating app and it's making me question their platonic friendship.

Background: I'm a widower (35) in my first post window relationship. Met GF (34) on dating app. Things have been going well. Dating for a year. We don't live together yet as I need to make room for another person in my home by getting rid of wife's excess stuff (she was kind of a hoarder). I also have health issues and will need an organ transplant, so I probably have a little anxiety about my health stuff which may play a role in this post.

Anyways, GF has a friend she met on a dating site. You can see where this is going I'm sure. I've met him and his GF. He seems fine and I've been assured by my GF that there were no romantic feelings on her side, but she did disclose that he disclosed that he had feelings for her. Since this guy had a GF, I didn't think much of it. However, he's been on and off with his GF lately. During one of those breakups a wedding came up and he asked my GF if she would go with him as he didn't want to go alone. No biggy I thought, but then it got a bit weird. I the wedding was out of town and he bought a double hotel room for him and my GF. My GF explained all this to me before agreeing and I said I would prefer you have separate rooms and I'll pay for it if it's a finance issue (I take home about 3x her income). She ended up staying with a different friend (married so not a concern) instead of the hotel, but it was a bit weird that we had to have that conversation. Whatever, not an issue, the friend gets back together with his GF and I largely ignore this.

Lately I've been helping GF with finance stuff and was logged into many of her accounts, with her explicit permission. I guess when you sign into google on a web browser it signs you into chat as well. I didn't know this because I don't use Google chat. I started seeing messages from this friend popping up on the windows notification bar. I haven't gone into her chats but I did read the pop ups because they were streaming infront of my face. Mostly normal looking stuff but very frequent, far more than I initiate chats with her. I started to feel a little weird about this friend again. I've left the browser logged in as I'm still doing finance stuff for her in my spare time. I've seen chats for a couple days now, mind you it's just the friends side of the chat. I'm not seeing the GF's chats so I'm only getting half the context. The frequency of the chats plus the regular dinners/calls that she has with this friend are now starting to weird me out a bit.

What would you do in this situation? I feel like I want to let it stay logged in a bit longer just to guage my level of concern. Another part of me just wants to dive into the chat window and see if I'm just letting a normal friendship get the better of me. And part of me feels like I should just sit her down and tell her what I inadvertently saw and why I'm getting weirded out.

The relationship other than this friend is good. I want her to move in but I know I need to get through the wife's stuff for that to happen and that's on me. Part of me feels like I'm fighting for her time a bit with this friend and in general I feel like if she really wanted to move in we could just move the wife's stuff to storage and figure it out some other time when I have the time to sort through it. I feel like if we were living together I wouldn't be as concerned about this friend as I wouldn't be vying for her time as much and I'd have a better sense of what her communication habits with him is like.",
relationships,My GF has a dating app on her phone,s1vsz4,Throwaway-tmd,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/s1vsz4/my_gf_has_a_dating_app_on_her_phone/,"My GF and I have dated for 3 months and has been obsessed with our future. I dated once prior to us getting together, no special relationship, just 9 months with constant flags of cheating my friends pointed out such as phone obsession, refuse for anyone to touch it, can’t view her camera roll, ignores for hours on end when she doesn’t wanna talk but freaks out when you take a 30 minute nap, small and stupid things they pointed out. I met S after about a year of being single and she had been single for a few months. Her history was longer than mine and was the only one to be broken up with, for whatever reasons while I had to end things after not wanting to be with someone I can’t trust. Day 1 this girl says she is ok with me looking through her phone and told me her pass code, I didn’t ask, we had gotten into a convo about exes and how it ended for each of us. She understood thing and although I never looked through her phone or even check photos she started looking through her snap chats and not opening some from guys, she also said not let me see her camera role after there was a video of a guy begging her for nudes and calling her “mommy.” I was uncomfortable with it but after reassurance I was ok with it. She had an app that I was on when I was younger which can be used for making friends but is ideally for young people to get into relationships. She deleted when I started asking about it and she said that it was used for people reacting to her singing when she hosted live videos and she said she didn’t use it anymore and deleted it. Today when we were cuddling i saw when she swiped past some apps that the logo. Was back there on her phone as if she reinstalled it. She’s home alone all day as she does online college and works part time on some days. I am a full time college student and work during the week days so i only see her during weekends and some Fridays if I am off. Maybe she is lonely and found someone else. I have major anxiety and worry she is cheating. I need help, what should I do?

tl;dr gf has dating app on phone after showing me she deleted it",
relationships,"Ex has been on my mind since I saw she ""liked"" me on a dating app. I'm currently three months into dating someone new but I don't think it's a long-term connection for me. Should I tell my current partner? (32M)(30F)",17v6q14,throwra_talktotheex,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/17v6q14/ex_has_been_on_my_mind_since_i_saw_she_liked_me/,"My ex and I broke up a little over two years ago after a short, \~6 month relationship. She was very honest with me and basically told me should couldn't stop seeking the attention of other men and that we needed to end things. She had some personal issues that I know she was working through in therapy, I'm sure this was one of them. I liked her, but to be honest by that point in the relationship I was kind of feeling similarly, I had just started giving serious thought to things like ENM, open relationships, and was just generally looking to have a more spicy ""sl\*t era"" of my own. It didn't really occur to me that my ex might have been down for this and we could have done it together, or I was just too chicken to bring it up in conversation. I don't have any reason to believe my ex ever cheated on me, from my point of view it seems like she did a very adult thing in ending our relationship when she really didn't want to (she cried a lot, reached out a few times in the following weeks, etc).

For the past 3 months I've been seeing someone I met off tinder. We both wanted to take things slow, she wasn't necessarily looking for a long-term relationship as she had just gotten out of a 9-year relationship at the beginning of the year and she told me she was on tinder to ""take things slow and meet new people along the way.""

About a month into dating we were talking about previous relationships and stuff, I told her I've only had a couple short relationships but I don't regret them. I have been thinking a lot about relationships recently, and how not every relationship needs to be on this ""ladder to marriage"" and it can be perfectly valid to enjoy connection, companionship, and feelings with someone even if you might not be planning to spend your life with them. I was speaking pretty abstractly, and not necessarily referring to our relationship specifically, which maybe I should have because it is kind of how I've been looking at it. She agreed with all this and had very similar views. I did explicitly tell her that I think I am in the ""figuring it out"" stage of my dating life.

I do think she is really into me though, she holds my hand a lot when we're together and other things like this. I'm not super lovey-dovey to her, and she isn't really either, but I think she may be viewing our relationship as something with more potential. I know I need to just talk to her about this, but it's hard to know what to say. Things are still early and neither of us explicitly have stated we want something serious so I have been keen to just let it progress naturally. I like her, I just don't think I'm falling in love or anything like that.

I haven't been on a date with anyone else since I started seeing her, but I also haven't stopped using dating apps. And that's how I know that my ex is back in the picture. Every time my swipe stack comes to my ex I close the app, but I know she has ""liked"" me because of the little, blurred out photo preview the app gives you of the people who have swiped right on your profile, the blurred photo at the top is obviously her.

I did enjoy dating my ex. On paper she checks more of the boxes of what I am looking for in a life partner than the woman I am currently seeing. We had really good chemistry, but I feel like I never opened up as my full self to her, which is something I would want to be better about were we to have another go at things. She is very successful professionally, and has clearly been taking time to work on herself. One thing I would definitely want to chat about if we did meet up again was if she is in a better place mentally and in terms of wanting to date/want a relationship.

So now I'm wondering what to do. I'm not 100% set on talking to my ex again, but it has been on my mind ever since I saw her on the app (over a month now). If I were to match with her and potentially talk to her again, maybe we'd meet for a coffee or something, should I tell the woman I am currently dating? Should I totally end things with her before even thinking about talking to my ex? Any advice is appreciated.

TL;DR: Been dating someone for 3 months and now my ex liked me on a dating app, if I were to talk to her should I end things with the woman I'm currently seeing first?",
relationships,"Is there ever a situation where a dating app would download ""by accident""?",tzcn0i,mexipeps,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/tzcn0i/is_there_ever_a_situation_where_a_dating_app/,"I feel like I already know the answer to this, but who knows, maybe I'm wrong.   
Basically, I've been in a rather messy relationship with my SO (24F & 27M) for about 6 years now. We have a toddler and I'm currently 34 weeks pregnant with our second. Our relationship has a lot of issues and has been on and off again for about the past 3 years due to various reasons I don't really need to get into.   
When I was pregnant with our now toddler, I was living on my own after kicking him out due to relapsing into a bad drug addiction.  
I went through the entire pregnancy and first year of our toddlers life alone, during which time he sought out help and got sober, went through many different therapies and finally did a 3 month long in-patient stay at a mental health oriented center. After all of this, I let him back into my life and into his sons life for the first time. Things were great. After about 6 months of just seeing each other on weekends and working through our past traumas together, I fell pregnant again, we moved in together. Oh what a mistake that has been.  
Relationship wise I haven't been happy since. He's a good dad and really gives it his all, but treats me like absolute garbage behind closed doors. We have not slept in the same bed once, not even once, since living together. He has his own space, I have mine, we keep it that way. We've had sex maybe... 5 times? in the past 7 months. This is all his decision. Being pregnant my emotions have been all over the place, I suffer greatly from anxiety and more recently depression, I'm very, very lonely.  
Through all of this he tells me how much he loves me, he wants to make things work between us, he wants to be together no matter what it takes blah blah blah. I'm at my witts end and have no faith in this, in all honesty I would have left a long time ago if I had the money. But he persists, he wants to be together. He loooves me. If I left it would crush him, etc. etc.   


Well, last night as we're having a fantastic time as a family at a drive-in restaurant, one of those rare times we're really enjoying each others company, he puts his phone down in front of me and I see the most recently downloaded app... is Hinge. Of course this hurt, I guess I wasn't surprised but it hurt and I asked about it. He tried to play it off like it was nothing, like he didn't know what Hinge was, he didn't download it, he doesn't know how it got there... He is just adamant that he didn't download this app. Or know what it was for that matter, but come on. We're both in our mid-late twenties and know what Hinge is... their marketing is everywhere. 

I didn't get too far into the conversation. I'm so numb to this kind of thing by now, why should I even bother. But I can't get it out of my head, I feel like he is playing some weird emotional manipulation trip on me when he says he loves me so much, I don't believe he feels that way at all anymore. Now it seems he's looking for other options? And lying about it? 

Basically, I just want to know if maybe I am looking too much into it, maybe it was somehow a mistake or... something other than the obvious. Is that even possible? Can a dating app get downloaded on android ""by mistake""?

TL;DR: I'm in a stale relationship, 34 weeks pregnant and found a dating app on my SO's phone that he denies ever downloading, or even knowing what it is.",
relationships,Ex [F21] on dating app,jejy82,ctoftheshootingstars,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/jejy82/ex_f21_on_dating_app/,"Tl;dr - Saw my ex on a dating app and had an anxiety attack. 

Me [M22] and my ex [F21] broke up around 2 weeks ago after the longest relationship we've ever had. Around 4.5 years. 

She's not the type to go into relationships quickly, and so am I. We broke things off trying to keep a positive mind about what happened during the relationship. And for now we're not talking as we're taking a break. But her breaking up with me was something certain, I mean she doesn't want to get back and it's not a temporary break up. 

Having said that I am now sort of looking for a fwb, to try and heal (probably not the best idea ever, but it might help my sexual frustration? Idk). So I installed a few dating apps among which there's bumble. I used it last week a little bit and guess who I see yesterday as I was swiping away... My ex. I locked my phone and put it down. 

My heart sunk. My breathing speed increased, my heart could not stop beating. I was having an anxiety attack. 

I tried to rationalise things as much as possible. -Bumble is to meet friends right? 
She has a very small circle of friends so must need more. 
-We're not together anymore. 
You shouldn't care about what she does with her life 
+Many other thoughts 

I don't really know what I expected. I knew this was going to be a possibility. Even if she does actually get with someone else. 

This is sort of the end of the post and I don't really know what to ask for, opinions? Advice? Help on how to deal with the situation? Similar experiences? 

I think maybe I just needed to tell someone, and your replies would really help me :)",

Tonight I got a random message from someone over Facebook. At first I thought it was spam so I don’t think too much about it. Then I checked the message and it was a girl from the same town my boyfriend lives in. She sent me screenshots of him being on a dating app and the conversation.

She had messaged first saying hi and my boyfriend replied with hey cutie. She then asked if he had a girlfriend and he said that he did and he was deleting bumble and wasn’t sure how they get cutie was sent in the first place. He also said he was trying to be polite and tell her he was deleting the app. 

After I got the screenshots I FaceTimed him and showed them to him and got upset (I believe I am clearly in the right to be) and hung up. He then proceeded to try and call me over 50 times in the span of half an hour. Finally I answered and he told me that he isn’t cheating on me and he only downloaded the app because he had got an email saying that there was a message for him and he wasn’t sure why because he hasn’t used the app since we first started talking. He tried to tell me he didn’t send the first two messages of telling this girl that’s she’s cute. I don’t believe that someone would hack into his account though and send someone a message. 

He told me that if he was actually cheating he wouldn’t try and talk to me and call me. I honestly don’t know what to do now. I completely believe he is lying to me. Is there anyway I can try and check to see if he’s telling the truth and not talking to random girls?

Some additional information me and him have been dating for over a year and he’s told me that he hasn’t been on any dating sites since we’ve started talking. We’re also in a long distance relationship so I can’t even ask to go through his phone to see if he’s telling the truth. 

TL;DR
My boyfriend of over a year was on a dating app and a girl sent me screenshots of the conversation. My boyfriend swears it wasn’t him and he was only deleting his account because of emails.",
relationships,Discovered Girlfriend (34) Had Active Dating App Profile During Our Initial Two Months Together; I (34/M) Found Out Nearly a Decade Later.,12umw5t,yurtbuilder,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/12umw5t/discovered_girlfriend_34_had_active_dating_app/,"**Background**

We have been dating since 2014. I met her through a mutual friend. I feel like at the time, my standards were a bit lower because I had just left the military where the male-to-female ratio was very skewed (I believe at the time, it was 1 female per 5 males). I'm 6'2, very fit, and women generally find me attractive, but in that environment, you're more or less competing for scraps. Anyways, I ended up settling right after I got out, or at least that's how I felt for the first five years of the relationship. Things did, however, get better as we both grew in so many ways, and now it's like we are different people. We are both fit, educated, and we run a very successful company together renting out yurts and bell tents (hence the name yurt builder).

**The Situation**

I kept hearing about this website that had indexed people's dating app profiles over and over again. It never occurred to me that someone I knew would be on a dating app because I don't personally use them, and I've heard negative things about them time and time again. However, my girlfriend recently mentioned that before she met me, she had used the dating app Bumble, which if you don't know is allegedly one of the most, if not the most used dating app.

&#x200B;

So after seeing ads, hearing people talking about it, and then reading a news article about this BuzzHumble site, I caved and paid them for this magical data trove they claim to have. Lo and behold, my partner did, in fact, have a dating app profile, and according to the records, she was active on Bumble using Date mode for the first two months of our relationship.

&#x200B;

I believe for most people and most situations this would be an open and shut case, but before I ask for your opinions on whether or not I should break up with her, I wanted to clarify that during the first two months we were dating, we were sleeping together at least four nights a week and she told me she wasn't seeing anyone else. I do understand that fledgling relationships often start like this, and I have no indications that she was unfaithful during the last decade.

&#x200B;

What bothers me so much though is the thought of sharing my partner, and that during those two months, sometimes she would have ""girls' nights out"", and I wouldn't hear back from her until the next day.

&#x200B;

I have so many years invested in this person, and I don't think I've attained the level of personal growth to deal with this situation on my own. Please give me your opinions on what you would do in my situation.

**TL;DR:** My girlfriend and I have been dating since 2014, and our relationship has grown stronger over time. Recently, I discovered she had an active dating app profile during the first two months of our relationship. Despite no indications of infidelity over the past decade, I'm troubled by the thought of sharing my partner during that period. I'm seeking advice on how to handle this situation.",

relationships,How do Ibring up I caught my boyfriend on a dating app sexting?,w7jfox,Agreeable-Farm-3969,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/w7jfox/how_do_ibring_up_i_caught_my_boyfriend_on_a/,"TLDR: I (M25) found my boyfriend (M27) on Grindr sexting or more. I want to confront him but don't know how because I don't want to throw everything away but I also need to know I can trust him going forward. I'm willing to give him a second chance because I love him but I'm not sure if this was just a one time mistake. How do I bring this up so I motivate him to be honest with me?  I would think the first reaction when you get called out is to deny it but then I won't know if I can trust him.

Hi, I (M25) started dating this guy (M27) on January and we really clicked which didn't hapen for me for 3-4 years and everything went great besides the fact that he lives in another city and has exhausting job so we were only meeting on weekends, mostly every other weekend. I shared my conserns but he explained he just can't spend with me more time and I accepted it because I new how busy he is and that he doesn't like to spend time after work with people. We even don't text that much which I also got used in time and respected it.

However I started to notice recently that he's much more online on whatsapp and facebook but he still didn't text me more. I thought to myself maybe he's talking with friends or coworkers but then once he was showing me something on his phone he had tinder and grinder installed. Other time he was showing me some pictures and I thoughtI saw an asshole pic there but he scrolled past fastly and tilted his screen to himself. I still thought I migh be paranoid. Until yesterday when we were at the restaurant and he went to the bathroom and a grindr message poped on his phone on the table. I started panicking inside and once I was home I created a profile and located myself neer him. Few hours later an another empty profile texted me. We exchanged few texts, photos (i used fake ones) and theres no doubt it's him. I asked what's he looking for and he said someone cool to which i replied I'm looking for a hook up and he said that sounds also great so I asked him if he wants to come over tommorow and have fun and he said yes. I asked when was the last time he had sex and he replied in spring and that sex is not that important to him. The thing about sex was a lie, we slept together this month so I asked if he's looking for something serious then if sex is no that important and he said he would't be agains it but a fwb is a great start. I also asked why he returned to grindr and he said he wants to give it another shot in finding someone great. Meanwhile a week ago he told me he uninstalled tinder because he thought it might upset me he's there even though he's not looking for anything. I called him today and asked where are we to give him a chance to tell me he is not sure anymore or something like that but he assured me we are good and he likes me and asked if I wanted to go to a trip next week and told me I scared him with that question. Back to grinder, I asked if I should pick him up today from work and he said he's not sure when he will be finished and I shouldn't count on him (this is bs because he always ends at the same time). Then I asked what would he like to do with me and he started sending nudes. His real nudes. I think maybe he's just BSing and says what the other guys whould like to hear to get some nudes out of them, but who knows, maybe he's really looking for something.

Right now I'm hurt and confused, I'm disgusted by myself that I'm catfishing him but I just didn't know what to do at the moment. I'm not sure if he's just having fun on grindr, maybe to sext and flirt a little or if he is really willing to cheat on me or if he's looking to replace me. I could forgive him if he just was horny and wanted to have a little fun online but it seems we can't trust eachother. He's a really great liar because I wouln't doubt him if I didn't see the message. This really saddens me because I though this one migh be the one finally. When I talk to him from my real account I can feel he feels guilt. But I don't know how long this has been going on. And the scare of the yesterdays call didn't stop him from sexting on grindr. I still see him online on whats app all day and can't stop thinking he's chatting with other guys there too.

We plan to call today after work and I'm not sure how to handle this conversation. I don't want to end this but I'm not sure if there's anything left to fix. I plan to say I'm having conserns he's not honest with me and I'd like to give him a chance to tell me if theres anything I should know. If he lies it's the end. If he doesn't....I don't know. I didn't sleep at all and I really fear of whats ahead of us because I really love him and I fear of another heartbreak.",
relationships,I (22) found out boyfriend (20) has been using dating apps for 'masturbation purposes'.,jbuzk8,melixxa,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/jbuzk8/i_22_found_out_boyfriend_20_has_been_using_dating/,"Hey guys, need some advice. Here's some backstory.

Boyfriend, let's call him Joe, and I have been dating for around 6 months. I assume we both like each other quite a bit and I genuinely believe that he's a good person.

At the very beginning of our relationship, 6 months ago, I saw Tinder on his phone while sitting next to him. I asked Joe why he uses Tinder and his answer was to meet new people. At the moment, I dropped it but later on, during a conversation on the topic, I told him it bothers me and he apologized, saying he understands and that he will delete it.

Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago, It came to my attention that he follows random girls on Instagram who live in our city. Because of Joe's past use of dating apps, I brought it up and he said he just follows random girls on suggested because he thinks they're attractive. Okay, not so suspicious but I kept this in the back of my mind. Sometime later, I noticed on Joe's Playstore that Tinder and OkCupid had been downloaded and deleted. FYI, I saw this because we use each other's phones and I needed to download an application on his phone. He denied using it and explained that he doesn't know why that happened. In the meanwhile, he is still following random girls on IG.

I was not convinced, and one day, while he was sleeping, I looked through his application download history. To my surprise, I saw at least 10-15 'dating apps' and the likes download then deleted through various intervals since June. I told Joe and he initially denied it, then confessed telling me that the reason why he uses such apps is that he thinks porn is 'too fake' and that he uses these sex/dating apps to look at women's photos or videos to masturbate. I asked him if he talked to any of these girls, he said no. After later 'questioning' he also claims to have talked to around 10 girls. I checked out these apps and the girls are like amateur 'cam girls' who get paid in coins or whatever. But I do know that he has chatted with real girls in our city from regular dating apps like Tinder or OkCupid.

Joe expressed his guilt and apologized. He said he knows it's wrong but that it's like an addiction and he has unsuccessfully tried stopping before. This issue was discussed for 2-3 days. At times, he would freak out or get angry. Claiming that I should forgive him because he immediately forgave me for kissing my female friend when I was drunk a while back. Telling me he knows what he did is wrong but that ""It's not that big of a deal and I don't think it's cheating. So I can't understand why you can't forgive me?"" Backstory on me kissing a girl, as soon as I remembered, I told him what happened the next morning. I'm bisexual and we had discussed the idea of me fooling around with women before.

I don't think Joe actually met up with anyone and had sex or anything with these women.

My biggest problem is that this is a long-term thought out lie. If Joe was honest with me about this, it could have been discussed and solved. Now my head is fucked. I really like him but my trust is broken.

I'm not sure how to proceed and honestly, I'm just looking for some outside opinions and insight. What are your thoughts? What should I do? What would you do in this situation?

Thanks.

relationships,I got asked a money-related question by a casual friend from a dating app and it made me uncomfortable,13hkv74,Original-Tap-4753,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/13hkv74/i_got_asked_a_moneyrelated_question_by_a_casual/,"There's a girl (22F) that I (21F) have been talking to from a dating app. Neither of us see it going beyond friends, but right now we're texting friends pretty much. We haven't shared numbers, but we shared our social medias with each other and know basic things about each other.

I felt a little bad when we were talking before about music festivals because she asked if I was going to any, and when I said which I was going to (one i saved for a few months to afford tickets for me and my sister to see), she said she wished she could have gone but couldn't afford tickets right now. I don't think she was saying it to make me feel bad, so I brushed it off.

But she's been kind of short with her replies since we shared social medias and I think my pictures may be why because out of nowhere, she asked me how I could afford to go so many places.

We haven't been talking long enough for me to really be comfortable answering this question. I don't think she means any harm by it, but I don't know how to reply.

The vacations aren't ones I paid for - most were paid for by my brother and one was paid for by my ex's family.

I don't want to tell her my brother paid for the majority of them because I don't want her to think we're rich - my bro worked hard to save enough for us to go on adventures together while I saved money to for food and taxis. I also don't want to tell her that my ex's family paid for one of them, not because it regards my ex (who I've haven't talked to in over a year), but because I don't want her to think I leech off of other people. I was close to my ex's family and they had an extra plane ticket so offered me to go - I never would have tried to invite myself.

Does anyone have advice on what to say? Is it okay to deflect or should I just answer the question? I felt like it was a little rude for her to ask but maybe I'm just overthinking this.

TL;DR: A girl I'm texting friends with from a dating app got kind of short with me after she saw my vacation pics on social media and then randomly asked me how I afford to travel. It made me uncomfortable since we haven't been talking for a very long time.

My brother paid for most of the vacations I went on, but I don't want her to think we're rich or that I leech off of other people. I don't know how to answer her question or if it's okay to just deflect the question. I need advice. :(",

We study at the same faculty and we have a lot of common friends, and we occasionally see each other on events in the Universtiy or at student parties. We'd always been in good terms, though we never got to know each other well.

After we matched, we had a brief conversation which went pretty smoothly, I think both parties were interested. After some time, though, she stopped texting me on the dating app, in a middle of a convo, leaving me on read. I didn't pay attention at first because I had a couple of other matches there but eventually lost interest in them. As for this girl, I think she doesn't use the dating app any more because she never goes online there.

A couple of days after we stopped texting, we met at a party and she was also friendly, we communicated briefly about some unimportant stuff, made some eye contact, as well. Unfortunately, I had to leave early, so we couldn't talk much.

I think I'm interested in this girl and I'd like to ask her out but I am not sure if I should see her dropping our dating app conversation on read as a sign that she doesn't see me as a potential date. Also, it's been a week or slightly more after the event (not the party but the chat), so I feel like it would be kinda weird if I asked her out now, wouldn't it?

**TL:DR**: I met a person I'd known before, on a dating app and she seemed fine with it. Although she stopped responding to my texts there, she was quite friendly when we saw each other at a party several days after that. Should I ask her out?",

This starts out how a lot of these posts do in that I was looking through my husband's phone which is bad and I fully acknowledge I should not do. To be honest, I have always had this terrible gut feeling I could not trust him. No evidence on why, just always this terrible gut feeling that he would cheat on me. So yes, I would look through his phone.

So I found a dating/sex hook-up app for transgender and people attracted to trans. I asked him if he was cheating on me or planning on cheating on me and he said no. I asked him if he knew what ""Dating App"" was he said no, no idea, never heard of it. So I was pissed because he lied to me right off the bat. I showed him screen shots I took of his profile and pictures he had posted. He confessed and I told him he could show me everything he has posted, all the conversation etc now or leave. He did and there were months and months of sexy conversations, pictures, videos. He said he has never actually met up with any of these people, but I don't know if I can believe him because he initially lied to me. 

It makes it even more difficult that he has been talking with MTF trans and clearly sexually attracted to this group of people. Let me be clear, I am totally in support of the LGBTQ community and identify as bisexual myself. But my husband is very specifically attracted to females with penis. He has actually always been somewhat judgmental and derogative towards transgender, which upset me. Has always been very adamant there are only two genders, which I disagree with. So to hear he is attracted to MTF women and was potentially trying to hook up with one is difficult.

I don't know how I can 100% believe he did not actually meet up with anyone else. I don't know how I can trust him to not do this in the future. I don't know if he is sexually attracted to me and vaginas in general. I don't know how to proceed.

He's the only person I can tell anything and everything to. We have been doing long distance (5 hours apart) ever since the beginning and our relationship has been going pretty smoothly and we've introduced each other to our families and I've met his friends. We FaceTime each other literally everyday so this quarantine doesn't feel any different for us. He is pretty open about his past, in the first few months he even showed me his dating apps he used before he met me. I made a few jokes about his profile and we both laughed it off. I remember him reassuring me that he doesn't need those apps anymore and I trusted him. Throughout the relationship he has helped me in my professional and educational career and I am so grateful for what hes done for me. We talked about how many kids we wanted, what kind of house, and how many pets we wanted. I planned out a life for us in my head. Today when we were facetiming I saw him using his old samsung phone in the dark swiping on a dating app. Im not sure which app b/c I never used a dating app before but I know that he was swiping through pictures of women. I didn't see him messaging anyone so it was just him swiping. I couldn't believe my eyes so I actually started screen recording him doing it.  The video lasted 2 and a half minutes. I just watched him swipe without saying a word and feeling my heart beating out of my chest because I didn't know what to say or do but I wish I did something. We eventually said goodnight to each other and here I am laying in bed not knowing what to do and no one to talk to because I don't want my friends to know yet. This is the first time I've ever caught him doing something like this. Does this count as cheating? Am I overreacting? How do I confront him? Do I show the screen recording?

relationships,Online stalker- dating apps,rbeqo1,6579flo,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/rbeqo1/online_stalker_dating_apps/,"
Hello! I am a (27) female and I searched for a partner online almost a year ago.. dating apps became my friend. I was recently divorced and figured this was a great way to move on. So wrong! Anyways, fast forward to 2-3 months later. I matched with a very considerate, caring, shy, fun to talk to guy. During our first date, he told me he had an online stalker and hadn’t figured out what or who was harassing him. Me not thinking I was going to continue the relationship, brushed it off and said that everyone must encounter a crazy person once in their lives… I quickly got attached to this guy after a few weeks (I also have an anxious attachment style). Before I could even get to know the guy. I fell for him and we were inseparable. Then the harassment started. The stalker, started messaging me and telling me that he is horrible and is an alcoholic. Treats women like shit, cheats, is lazy, etc. I brushed it off thinking that it was an ex. He told me that he didn’t know who it was. I was always skeptical, but ignored it. I was not fully using my logical brain and continued the relationship. Online harassment became my daily life. She escalated from warning me, to insulting me and saying horrible things about my appearance. She reached out to my friends, coworkers and family. I broke up with the guy about 3 times. I was conflicted and didn’t know what to do. Many other things happened during our relationship. He’s an avoidant partner. 9 or so months later. His drinking got bad. I knew it was time to walk away. He ended up being aggressive and messaging many mean things. Finally after 2 months of still messaging him, calling him, and seeing him after I “ended it,” I finally did end it. The stalker was gone for awhile during the relationship.. recently she has reappeared. About 2 weeks ago she messaged me telling me that she was right and he has been cheating since day one. During this time, he also went back to seeing someone he has known for 8 year. She treats him like a baby and he likes it but uses her because he doesn’t see a relationship with her. And I guess she likes to be used and needed. So I can’t help but think that his friend/fuck buddy is involved and she has been behind the screen all along. He denied it of course. 

TL;DR! Online stalker is still harassing me even after leaving the guy that she’s obsessed with. Making me think that the stalker could be his fuck buddy or 8 years.",
relationships,Guy (25M) I'm (20F) dating told me to keep my dating app accounts active,ebo9o2,helpplz1235,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ebo9o2/guy_25m_im_20f_dating_told_me_to_keep_my_dating/,"I've (20F) been dating a guy (25M) for four months now and he doesn't want to commit. Some context, we live in different cities because of work (about an hour away by plane) but will be moving closer together in a months time.  I never minded that we weren't exclusive as he explained to me he thought this was the only way we could be together as a long distance couple, but as we will be living in the same city soon and he said if we did then we would be exclusive, I feel as though we should at least be heading in the direction of exclusivity since it's almost time. However, he's been making comments that sound like he isn't serious about me, like how he's not sure what the future is like and also that I should keep my old dating app account. At the same time he says he does think things will progress with me, but that he's happy with the way we are. 

I think I have stronger feelings for him than he does for me, because I can't see myself with other people when I'm dating someone. I agreed to not being exclusive mainly for his needs, knowing I wouldn't be dating or sleeping with anyone else purely because I can't have feelings for multiple people at a time. But his jabs about keeping dating app accounts hurt my feelings, and it feels like he's encouraging me to find someone else. When I showed that this bothered me he told me he was tired of me acting that way and stopped talking to me for the rest of the night, which hurt me even more. I understand he might be frustrated with me being hurt because I agreed to an open relationship, but he knew I didn't want to see other people. I'm really starting to feel unhappy being with him, because it feels like I'm fighting for his attention sometimes, and I don't think he actually cares about me very much.

Am I being unreasonable and impatient about this or should we just split up?

TL;DR 

I'm in an open long distance relationship that was meant to be exclusive in a month, even though I don't want to see other people, my partner said I should keep my online dating accounts active anyway, and basically told me to shut up when I showed that this comment bothered me.",

I found out 1 week ago by looking in his mobile phone, I’m still chocked about what I’ve seen. I just know that I love him and I want give him another chance because if I don’t do it I will regret it later. 

He told me that he started 8 years ago because he was really sad in his sexual life with his ex gf (which I can understand because he stayed 8 years with her and only had sex 30 times with her). I think he needed validation and excitation.

He also told me that it was only virtual life and never wanted to see those girls in real life (we live in France, he was talking to girls in USA mostly, never wanted to talk to French girl, it’s what I’ve seen on his Snapchat too). 

He delated all the apps, delated social apps and all the email address he used. He also told the story to all his friends and even his mother. He also have an appointment with a psychologist and psychiatrist.
I want trust him and give him this chance. But I’m soo confused. 

I’m here because I wanted to know if someone lived the same things ? Do you think it’s possible to stop this kind of addiction ? Can I trust him? 
Do you have advice ? 

Thanks a lot 🙏🏻

They had fought about it all night and she gave Waste back her engagement ring, but told him ""not to lose it"". So, my guess is she stays with him and they go through with the marriage. Thank you all for the advice! 


My sister (24) has been seeing this guy (we'll call him Waste) for about 3 years and they got engaged this fall. He is a grade A asshole in my opinion and treats my sister like crap most of the time. He moved here from out of state to be with my sister but, almost every time he goes to visit his hometown he cheats on my sister or does something relatively unfaithful (and yes my sister knows about MOST of these instances).

So this time around, I get a phone call from my and my sisters mutual friend telling me that she just saw Waste on a dating app, and then I got a phone call from 3 other mutual friends saying the same thing. They sent me a screenshot of his profile and it has been updated to his current age and location.

Now, disclaimer, I don't know how dating apps work I've never used one before. But, I was told that the location only updates if you use the app. And, his age was updated so we know that he's used it within the last few months (his birthday was this fall, too). 

So, there's a couple conclusions. 
1. He just got back from visiting his hometown so he downloaded it while there and forgot to delete it when he came home?
2. He has been using the dating app blantantly and doesn't care who sees that he's on it because he has such little respect for my sister 

So that's where I'm at. I don't know what to do with this information . Do I go to my sister and tell her what I know? Do I confront him and ask him what he thinks he's doing? Do I just leave it alone and pretend I know nothing?? Any advice is better than no advice.

TDLR - My boyfriend (20) of nearly 3 years breaks up with me (20), goes on a dating app within hours of being home from a holiday, which I was broken up on. I’m so angry and confused, am I overreacting. Any thoughts would be great.

Hi,

My ex boyfriend of nearly 3 years broke up with me whilst he was on holiday this week, I was obviously incredibly heartbroken and felt like we could have rekindled after however long of working on ourselves. As he said that he just wants to chill, do his own thing and told me ‘not to worry’ as he didn’t want to deal with anyone else ‘for a very long time’. I find out that within a few hours of him returning back home, (3 days after the breakup) he’s signed up for this app with all his photos on, saying he’s online and that he’s looking for dates and hookups etc.

I confronted him and it just ended in a big argument with him getting so angry and incredibly defensive and blocking me on every platform. He could not understand how this looks to me at all, I said I feel embarrassed and hurt by his actions.

I’m so angry, upset and confused, I understand that people deal with breakups differently, that he’s single and can do what he wants and that he most likely fell out of love for a period before ending things with us but still, to jump on an app like that so so soon is so hurtful. Does he not think at all about how this looks?

I believe the saddest thing is that I’m now questioning the whole relationship thinking about every happy memory, every plan for the future we made, thinking was it real? I don’t believe I was cheated on but it obviously raises questions when he’s able to do something like this, he definitely had the time to if he wanted whilst we were together. His feelings towards me couldn’t be as true as he was saying, there’s just no way.

Any thoughts/feedback on this would be greatly appreciated - thanks.",

I’ve dated this girl for 3 mo after we met on an app and in that time period it’s been really great and loving. We connected quickly and moved things fast and have been living together literally since the start. We spoke multiple times about eventually getting a place together for real and had intentional talks of our future together. Normally she and I would text all day every day when we’re not together. That suddenly changed when I went on this 11 day trip to Italy with my sister that I’m currently on. She’s been distant and cold acting towards me mixed in with enough loving comments and attention to keep me talking to her. She also rarely hung out with friends when we were together and barely introduced me to any. In fact stating she didn’t initially want to add our relationship status on her Facebook because she “didn’t want her friends to harass me about it.” Since I’ve been on my trip, she has gone out and drank with friends every single night. She even told me she hadn’t eaten in 4 days. 

I have been trying really hard to be supportive during this distance and encouraging to see her friends and I appreciate the honestly in telling me what she’s getting into every day, even if it’s much more brief than usual. But things are getting progressively harder with consistency in our texting and I’ve noticed a change in the way she talks to me. 

She told me very early on that she was going to delete the app we met on but after all of this sketchy attitude she’s been showing me, I checked and saw that she was still in fact on the app and was last online yesterday. I am not usually one to stalk around but something has been up and I listened to my intuition and see that she’s being dishonest. 

I am in a different country right now for 6 more days and would really prefer not to have “the talk” right now but she has been really putting a huge damper on a trip that was supposed to be incredible for me and my sister and I’m just feeling like I’ve lost all control over my relationship suddenly. 

I need advice on how to ask her why she’s suddenly acting distant and cold to me and try and get her to be honest about her intentions. 

Tl;Dr My relationship went from very loving and close to distant and cold communication right when I went on vacation to Italy.

Always taking an opportunity when I see it, but never really going out seeking a relationship or intimacy. I've been single for about a year now. I feel lonely, not in the type of way where I need more people in my life, but in the way that I need some sort of intimacy in my life. Whether it's just talking, or a relationship, or hookups I don't really care, I just want to find something that will make this feeling go away. I'm hesitant to try dating apps because it's never been my style to go out seeking something, and also I'm not in the greatest physical shape/I'm insecure about my body so I feel that might turn quite a few people off. Any thoughts?

TLDR: Dating apps aren't really my style but I'm tired of waiting for something to happen. Should I try them?",
relationships,"My friends (28F) partner (30M) is on dating apps without her knowledge, how do I go about telling her?",16scqgl,Hyper_Chenle01,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/16scqgl/my_friends_28f_partner_30m_is_on_dating_apps/,"Hi all, just looking for some advice here. My friend (lets call her Trisha) and her partner (lets call him Micheal) have been dating for close to two years now and are looking to move in with each other. They seem really strong and from what i've heard, Micheal is a great guy and really loves her. I'm not too fond of him for reasons I wont get in to however. For some context (although it don't think it really matters) Trisha is polyamourous while Micheal is not, however their relationship is closed and this is a well known thing. However I heard today from a friend of a friend that she has seen Micheal on tinder. It first I thought maybe she had gotten him mixed up with someone else (theres a lot of other Micheals out there) or that maybe it was his old account from before they started dating, but apparently tinder stops showing your account to others if you are inactive for longer than 7 days so that doesnt check out. I maybe thought they had decided to open the relationship, but I got confirmation from her recently that their relationship has always been and is still closed. I 100% want to tell her about it, because if I were in her situation I would absolutely want to know regardless of the circumstances, but im totally unsure how to go about it. She really likes him, and I can see her getting defensive, and shes my best friend and I don't want her to cut me off. I thought about getting in touch with the person who actually saw him on tinder, but I wasn't supposed to know about it as I heard it through a mutual friend who agreed he wouldn't tell anyone in case things are just blown out proportion. Trisha also doesnt trust the friend who told me, and might be inclined to think he was lying. I have no actual solid evidence, just through word of mouth. How should I go about this? Any advice would be appreciated. 

tl;dr - my best friends partner is on dating apps without her knowledge, how do I tell her? ",

Everything is going well: sex is great, we always have fun, we’ve met each others families, and even traveled together. We’ve exchanged sentiments about being “serious” and “seeing a future together”. We click so well and have practiced refreshing openness with each other. I thought everything was perfect. 
He even said i was his dream partner and tells me constantly how great/hot i am and how much he loves/adores me.

But yesterday, the day after valentine’s day, we were talking and he admitted that he never deleted any of his dating apps. He said he just turned off notifications and moved the folder to the his second page when we started seeing each other and forgot they were there.

Should i be doubting our relationship? Like i thought he was super into me and wanted to eventually have a life together. Should I sort of pump the breaks and make things more casual? I feel like a fool.

relationships,How should I (21TM) go about handling this complicated situation with one of my best friends (20TM) and a new person (20TM) I met off a dating app?,16boby0,randommizzou,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/16boby0/how_should_i_21tm_go_about_handling_this/,"Soooo, long story short, I have had this friend for about a year and a half now, and within the past year I've developed feelings for him. We click really well, but I didn't feel anything other than platonic feelings until the beginning of last school year (college). I had a little mini-crisis when I first started feeling things for him, but I've calmed down since. I've really been suppressing my feelings bc I am terrified of rejection and also don't want things to be awkward if he doesn't feel the same way. Anyway, as much as I have stopped fixating on how I feel about him, I've just become more sure of those feelings. Whenever we are together, I want to be closer to him, so I've kinda been at a loss for what to do.  
  
Recently, considering I had decided not to tell him about how I felt, I went back on dating apps. Not to distract, just to meet new people. Usually, nothing even semi-serious comes of it, but I met this one person with whom I got along really well. After we met for a quick coffee on campus one day, we decided to make breakfast together the following weekend. Though things got a bit awkward when we said goodbye, it went well, so we are hanging out again on Thursday.  
  
After this, I text my friend about this new person and the sort of awkward goodbye and they're like ""was this a date?"" and I told them I did not know, but assumed it was. So, they then said that I should ask whether it was, like whether the vibes are platonic, romantic, or something in between, which I agreed with. I decided to ask on Thursday, when we had planned to study together.  
  
But then, I was thinking about the whole situation this morning, a bit removed from the small mortification of last night, and got really anxious about what would happen if things moved further with this person. More specifically, how much of a loss I would feel if things kept going well and I started dating this person, but it turns out all along my best friend also had feelings for me. Like would our current dynamic change if I told him that I had a partner? And would I be okay with that? I cannot overstate how strongly I feel about him, like it's actually scary. So because of this, I have decided that it's time to tell him how I feel. Going on a date(?) with this other person has scared(?) me enough into action I guess?  
  
So, this upcoming Friday me, him, and our other best friend are hanging out at his and I'm staying the night, which is not unusual for me (our other friend is not). I am pretty damn sure I'm gonna tell him that night, that way I've at least got it off my chest (no pun intended). I have also decided to NOT ask the person I went on a date with about what type of connection they're feeling on Thursday, but rather wait until a bit later, after I've talked to my friend. That way, if things with my best friend move forward, I haven't led them on. If my best friend wants to stay strictly friends, it would suck, but then I would feel comfortable pursuing things romantically with the other person (if they want); if he's somewhere in between, I have no idea what I going to do lol; and if he feels similarly, then I'd probably clarify with the other person that I'm not interested romantically (sidenote: when me and this other person met, they said they're looking for friends but they're open to a romantic connection, so I'm pretty sure they'd be okay with staying friends, but you never know). As scared as I am to tell my best friend, it honestly scares me more to lose what we might potentially have (as i've been getting some ?? vibes perhaps recently idk).

TL;DR  I have really strong feelings for one of my best friends (1. 5 years), but I met someone off of a dating app that I also liked. I'm scared of not telling my best friend how I feel before my relationship with the new person (1 week) moves forward any further. I plan to tell him the next time we hang out.

Should I go through with this plan? Or am I just being unnecessarily reactive?   
  
I'd like any advice/support you're willing to offer, please and thank you!",

I got kind of bored and eventually just said “would u be down to FaceTime and if we like each other we can hang in real life” this was my way of cutting to the chase. He said “yeah! Ofc I would!

Basically, I'm 23 but I've never had a true relationship, so I still have some ideals that a teen watching Disney Channel when they were 12 would have, and I know they're just ideals and that they're definitely not true, but my brain still doesn't get it. 

Basically I'm talking to this girl for like 1-2 weeks (yes I know it takes more to know the person, but keep in mind my 12 year old analogy) and we're being pretty honest to each other. We do flirt sometimes, but we both would rather be super open about what we're thinking.

 The other day we got into the topic of relationships, and basically she said she was still not ready for one since her last 5 year relationship didn't end well, but she mentioned she's looking for a FWB. Since I've got not experience I asked her how does it work, if it's a monogamous thing or not, and she said she wants a monogamous FWB. I was reading that FWB in general are kinda volatile, (don't know about monogamous but I would assume it's the same) and you can end up really hurt from those, so I don't know what to do really. 

Yes, I know it's been only 2 weeks since we've met but I'm interested in her and I don't know if I could handle she finding another partner while we are in the said FWB relationship. I wouldn't mind waiting but it's already eating out at me, to the point where I hear the message notification and my heart starts beating fast. Do I just go with it? Refuse? Wait til something actually happens? Or just straight up talk about it?

TLDR: Girl mentions FWB when I think I might want more than that, even though she said she will only have 1 partner at a time.",
relationships,Found dating apps on my boyfriend's phone,rcbogp,AryaB,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/rcbogp/found_dating_apps_on_my_boyfriends_phone/,"My(25F)  boyfriend(25M) and I broke up when he moved to a different state (XYZ).  We mutually agreed to not have a long-distance relationship (personal preferences). Even though we broke up, we still talked frequently and were in touch. Honestly, it was not easy for me, we were together for two years. Anyway, after 5 months he got a job in my city, and he moved back. We did not immediately get back together because I was scared to go through the breakup again if one of us were to move somewhere else. His moving back made things even more difficult, I realized that I can't be just friends with him. It was hard to see him and not be able to properly hug him because I did not know where the new boundaries were.  After a month, I decided to have an honest conversation with him to share where I stood emotionally. He said that he still loves me, and we got back together.

Things were back the way they were before until I found that he has dating apps on his phone. When I asked, he said that he downloaded it when he moved to XYZ.  He shared that he spoke to a couple of people on the app but did not pursue anything. He also talked to someone when he moved back here, and they met up once (before we got back).  He added that his feelings for me did not change, but idk if my feelings changed after learning about this.

Ik when he was in XYZ he was feeling very lonely because he knew no one there, and his work was completely remote, so rarely left his apartment. I get it that he might have wanted to make some connections. I also acknowledge that he wasn't cheating as technically we were not together during that time. But ever since I found out about it I have been feeling very hurt, I don't know how to rationalize my feelings.

This has led to me thinking if it was that easy for him to move on and doubting his feelings for me. I  love him but if he doesn't feel the same, then I won't force my feelings onto him. I do not know what to do now, and how to justify why am I feeling the way I am right now.

FYI I did not date anyone during that time. I was not emotionally or mentally ready for it.

I feel like I'll just end up with whoever happened to be the most available and fit with whatever ''goals'' I have for the foreseeable future. That's not really a problem for me, but maybe I'll feel like I missed out later on ?

UPDATE: It's been a little under a month since I've left him. I had my 2-day abortion procedure and while it was a difficult decision, I feel relief. I have no close friends that would have been willing to escort me to the clinic and stick around for my recovery so I'm extremely grateful for my mom who was able to do that for me. She is definitely the person who is helping me find strength in this time and is I am living with for the time being. 


I ended up going in for a full panel of STI testing because I cannot trust his word that he did not sleep with anyone else. Unfortunately, I am infected with an annoying, but non-life threatening virus --- yeah THAT one. I know that he transferred the virus to me because he is the only person I have been with. I suppose I'm fortunate in that I am asymptomatic but I know that the amount of baggage I hold will send many future prospects running. Not only is it humiliating to have been betrayed like this, but to top it all off, I feel like damaged goods.



The day I left him I haphazardly packed my car and was not able to fit everything in one trip so I had to return about a week after the abortion to pick up my remaining items. We were living together with a roommate before we planned on moving into the house. Upon arrival, she informed me that he had moved into what was going to be our house, by himself. She told me that he pawned my engagement ring and used the money to buy a dog and a puppy. She said she went over to see how he was doing and apparently there was poop all over the house from a non-potty trained puppy and the dogs were covered in fleas. As of late, he had to abandon the puppy. Her telling me this just makes me realize that my decision related to this pregnancy was the best thing I could have done. Someone who cannot keep up with a puppy is definitely not equipped to handle a baby and I feel like a fool for actually being on board to start a family with this impulsive idiot.



My ex and his family do not know that I had an abortion ---  being that they are right-wing fundamentalist Christians, they are under the impression that I had miscarriage management surgery. My ex reached out to me via text saying that he wants to do something nice for me and offered to send me $100 a month, but that he could only do that for 6 months. He said that he would do anything to get me back. (For whatever reason he is under the impression that I WILL take him back.) I reminded him that he is selfish cheater who ruined everything and that I can never trust him again and essentially to go fuck himself. He then retracted his offer of sending money saying it was pointless to do if there was no chance of us being together again. I really know how to choose 'em, huh?

   

**tl;dr**: My ex-fiance cheated on me and it was extremely difficult for me to walk away because I was pregnant. Since I left, I ended up having an abortion and also discovering that he transferred an incurable STI to me.",

I now have him on Snapchat and we have been snapping each other pictures of ourselves with text and have conversations every day about what we’re up to, how our days have been going, etc. He always shows genuine interest in what I have to say and how I have been feeling. He also never gives dry replies and has never left me on opened either, though sometimes, he isn’t active for hours at a time. 

We have not talked about hanging out yet, but he lives several hours away from me (though he tells me he will be moving closer very soon) and I’ve been super busy with my personal life, so it makes sense that neither of us have brought it up. I was thinking about asking him to hangout once he moved as it would making things a lot easier for the both of us.

I am really interested in dating him, but I don’t know if he feels the same way as I do. Since we have never met in person either, it has been very hard to catch the vibe over text. 

Do any of you have any advice on what I should do? I have very little relationship experience and have a hard time telling when people are interested in me.

I posted a few days ago because I found my fiance on an online dating site. I took reddit's advice and catfished him...

A few hours after I set the bait, I found that his profile had been deleted.

When he came home from work I showed him the screen shot and asked him what was up.

Long story short, He was hanging out with his coworker and the coworker was frustrated with figuring out how to navigate the ame dating site. My fiance signed into his old account (opened in 2013) to try to help his friend figure it out. Apparently a lot had changed on this particular site and he realized that his knowledge on the site was too out of date so he logged out and that was it. A few days later he saw in his email that he had gotten a message from a woman on the site and he then deleted his account.

He obviously couldn't show me his dating site account, but he did volunteer to show me his email account with all the alerts from the site, the only woman that had messaged him recently was clearly my fake account. He also realized when we were looking through his email that he had an unused old profile on another dating site, he signed in and deleted that one in front of me.

I fessed up about catfishing him. He wasn't upset at all. Said he understood completely considering my history. He was more upset with himself for not realizing that his behavior would make me so insecure.

I apologized for not trusting him and catfishing. He apologized for being so distant lately and not deleting his dating profiles ages ago.

He offered an open phone/social media/email policy between us, in case we ever stumble across another ""trust but verify"" type of situation.

Tl;Dr: It was an old profile. He signed in to try to help a friend figure out the app. He saw the message from my catfishing attempt, thought they were real and deleted his profile. We talked it over, no one is mad. Life is good.",

After some talks he stated he didn’t swipe or talk on the apps and just updated his age in the bio out of curiosity, and so I forgave him based on the promise that he’d be upfront and honest with me. Fast forward to today I found out he did in fact swipe on dating apps, but as a “game” between his friends where they rated the profiles. He insisted I ask his friends but I have lost trust in his words after recent actions. 





Me and my boyfriend have been dating since January this year, nearing our 6 month anniversary next month. 

I knew he has used dating apps previous to the relation, and as I saw a post on Reddit about dating app profiles, I got curious and asked if I can see his bio if he had any screenshots from the past (this happened on Saturday). 

What followed was him logging in and sending me a screen shot of his bio in real time. I was not bothered that he hadn’t deleted his profile, as long as he was not using since we got together. However seeing his updated age in the bio made me realize he had accessed and manually updated his age in the bio since we had been dating (as we had celebrated his birthday in February). I confronted him at the time on phone and after a while he said he had accessed the app as curiosity got the better of him and said he had the age set as older than his real age from before as he wanted to seem more “mature”. He emphasized that he did not swipe or talk to anyone on the apps since we got into a relation, and so I let the conversation go and asked him to be honest so we can overcome these problems earlier from next time.

Fast forward to today, I was at his house and I joked about using his dating app to see if there was anyone I knew in the local area as we both grew up in the neighborhood. He had deleted bumble since the talk but still had his tinder account. We were completely fine about the topic since we had talked it over and he assured me he had not been active in talking or swiping since January. However as he logged in, a notification that he got a match on late may popped up. After confronting him, he eventually confessed that him and his friends stream the dating app to discuss profiles and “swipe” the attractive ones agreed on by the group on discord (apparently a running tradition since before we dated)which was peculiar to say the least. He said he’d do it 2am drunk and felt terrible afterwards so did not tell me and “sugarcoated it”. He insisted I contact his friends who’d back up that it was just a game, however I do not know this person well and I don’t think I can trust them even if they substantiated the claims. 
It has literally been 2days since we agreed to be honest and that’s what has broken my heart, and I’m not sure if I can trust him anymore.

He has continually focused on his intentions not being bad and doesn’t seem to understand my issue even after the conversation. I’ve told him I need some time to gather my thoughts but I’m honestly not sure how to approach the situation. 

I’m not sure if being petty or if it is a reasonable response. Any advice is appreciated greatly! Thank you for taking your time to read this long post",
relationships,Is it bad if I [27F] delete and redownload dating app if I'm two dates into seeing someone [27M]?,okyflc,WarmBonus6560,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/okyflc/is_it_bad_if_i_27f_delete_and_redownload_dating/,"I'm feeling like I need to delete and redownload Hinge, as I do maybe 2-3 times a year. About a month ago, I matched with a guy on there, and due to summer travel, have only been on two dates, with our third date not taking place for another 2 weeks or so due to that same reason. I like this guy enough, and it's still early, but right now I'm not sure it's going to turn into a relationship or anything. Is it going to be a bit awkward if I delete and redownload the app? So my profile disappears, and then he could potentially come across it again? What's the etiquette here?

relationships,I (20/M) met a (20/F) on a dating app online and within two weeks already dating. Is this normal?,ckaobr,throweeeaway212,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/ckaobr/i_20m_met_a_20f_on_a_dating_app_online_and_within/,"So  I met this girl (20/F) on a christian dating app, it is not a popular  app. I wasn't expecting to find anything, definitely not something that  could be serious and last. After I been on the app for a couple weeks, I  matched with this girl who is 2 and 1/2 hours away from me. No problem  I'll make that drive if things turn out to work, so we start talking.

Right  after I gave her my number we immediately hit things off and we really  connected. We call each other and talking during the day and literally  all night, we both talked about what we wanted from this. I never been  in a relationship, but she has been in several and they all turned out  bad because the only thing the guys wanted from her is sex she said. She  hasn't been in a relationship for about two years. She specifically  said that she never has met someone like me who cares so much about her  and is genuine. I made it clear that my motive isn't to have sex, but  something serious, and she explained she wants to wait until we are  married to mess around. I said I'm on the same page, and we both talked  about how we are exclusive and two days after that conversation. We  started dating without ever meeting, and now we are planning to meet.  Literally last night we fell asleep together on the phone/facetime and  woke up to eachother. We constantly talk about our future, and  hypothetically what we would name our kids, what our marriage would look  like, and how we both want to travel.

I  really feel like we are made for each other due to how many things we  have in common. We constantly talk, and we are super cheesy within our  relationship, but I love it. She is in college, and so am I. We are in  basically the same major and are both seniors.

I  told one of my buddies about it and he said i'm an idiot for jumping into this so fast with a girl and already saying i love you with someone  I never even met in real life, two weeks into meeting her online. I  understand where he is coming from, but I feel like me and this girl are  both mature, along with knowing what we want. She constantly says she  can't wait for me to come up, hug me, kiss me, and I without a doubt  feel the same, but I just try to limit me admitting that to avoid being  seen as clingy. I told her I sometimes worry about us not working out cause I feel like we are made for eachother and she said she feels the same, but shes not going anywhere and that shes going to walk down the aisle with me one day.

Is this normal?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Tl;dr: I met a girl on a dating app, within two weeks we are already dating and saying I love you without even meeting in real life yet. My buddy told me i'm an idiot and going to fast in this, but I feel the exact opposite and that I just met someone who we both just really connect with.",
relationships,"I [F34] found out my BF [M35], who I live with, is using a dating app. What should I do?",qfm3kx,AmyyyyBlack,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/qfm3kx/i_f34_found_out_my_bf_m35_who_i_live_with_is/,"We  have been living together for about 6 months. We've been having a few  arguments lately but I didn't think they were really too much of a big  deal.

One of my friends messaged  me this morning saying she saw him on Feeld (a dating app). I confronted  him about it and he confessed. He said he was feeling low and depressed  last week and that he often feels like he's not enough for me  (apparently because of our fights). Let me be clear, I've never  threatened to break up with him or made it seem like any of our issues  were so big that they're deal breakers. I think we always make up after  our arguments (and are often closer afterwards) and that it's inevitable  that couples argue sometimes.

He justified being on the app by saying he was depressed and it was stupid but he needed to feel like he was still attractive.

Do I need to leave him? What should I do? It's horribly sad because I thought he was  the one. We had been talking about buying a house and starting a family.

(This  guy is not the same relationship I was posting about 2 years ago. We've  been together for about 18 months and lived together for 6 months)

tl;dr: Found out BF is on a dating app; we live together and had been discussing starting a family.",

I met his guy a little over 4 months ago on a dating app. We went on two dates and they were great. But then COVID happened and we haven’t been able to see each other since. We’re mainly texting/video calling right now and it’s been wonderful. 

We haven’t talked about exclusivity yet, and I’d like to bring up the topic but I feel like it’s too early for him. I understand that and I’m okay with it, especially since we have been only on two dates. 

The problem is I found out that he’s still active on the same dating app we met. He swiped right on my friend and he texted her while ignoring my texts.  I know we’re not exclusive but it still hurts and I feel like it’s some form of red flag? I’ve had a stream of abusive, toxic relationships and I’m terrified of falling into the same pattern. 

I don’t know what to do. Should I be worried about this? 


TL;DR: Man I’m seeing is still active on dating app where we met",
relationships,I (26F) snooped on my boyfriends (26M) computer and found out he's on dating apps. What now?,s0gisl,CrocodilePotato,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/s0gisl/i_26f_snooped_on_my_boyfriends_26m_computer_and/,"My  boyfriend and I have been together for about 7 months now. Not a lot  but enough to not be in the dating stage of things anymore. We met on  Tinder and neither of us were really looking for anything serious at the  time but we ended up really liking each other. Other than this entire  situation our relationship has been really good. I feel loved and  appreciated and our communication has been excellent, which is why I'm  so confused right now.

The backstory to the entire situation is as follows:

A  month into dating he proposed being exclusive to which I asked if we  should be deleting our Tinder accounts. He wasn't really ready for it at  the time and he said he'd like to keep his for a while longer. I get  it, it's sort of a security blanket for if things fall through and you  want a quick rebound. I agreed to this and said I'd approach the topic  again later.

A month later he told  me he deleted Tinder and I thought we were done with it, but apparently  not. A month ago, so six months into the relationship he told me he  loved me and that he had gone back and deleted his Tinder account for  good. This bothered me because I thought he had already done that. Turns  out he just deleted the app off his phone but kept the account.

I  decided to let it go at the time but it just kept eating at me for  weeks, I felt lied to, even though the way he worded it wasn't  necessarily a lie.

A few days ago I  was at his place for a couple of days and I did something I've never  ever done with anyone. I snooped on his computer. In his browsing  history I found he had not only been on Tinder but Badoo as well and  recently. It seemed like he was on there every day or every other day. I  was in shock so I didn't really think to check the chats that much but  it seemed like he wasn't talking to other girls that much and I saw no  mentions of meet ups. What fucked me up was the fact that his profile  picture was a photo I took when we were out on a date just three weeks  ago.

I really have no idea what to  do in this situation. I want to talk to him about it but I feel so  guilty about looking at his computer. I even went as far as making a  fake account and found him on Badoo for a screenshot. I never thought  I'd be that person. Then again, I found what I was looking for.

I  know I need to talk to him about it, but how do I approach this whole  thing? Should I come clean and say how I got the information?

 **TL;DR** I found out through snooping that my boyfriend is on dating apps even though he's said on several occasions he's deleted the app/account.",
Report_scams,Shop Innovator : work from home scam!,1csyxmb,InternationalFix6484,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1csyxmb,"Shop Innovator- work from home scam

I would like to warn everyone who uses this app to be cautious when dealing with any company that claims to be involved in USDT crypto. If a company contacts you through What's App and offers you the opportunity to earn money by checking apps on the ISO App Store or The Play Store, please exercise extreme caution, especially if they promise payment in USDT Coins using the OKX App. While it is not yet completely clear whether the OKX app is involved in this scam, there appears to be a strong connection between a company called Shop Innovator and the app. 

Based on the information I have gathered, the scam works by luring individuals like myself who have a UK bank account and UK driving license or passport to set up accounts with OKX. Once you have set up an account, they will ask you to complete a task for which they will pay you in USDT. They will then instruct you to transfer the cleared funds into OKX and subsequently ask you to send those funds back to BADRHYNO. However, you will not receive anything in return. They will inform you that you need to continue doing this task for five days in order to receive your commission in USDT. On the third day, they will introduce an additional fee that will put you in negative USDT within the BADRHYNO account. They will then demand that you use your own money to purchase USDT through the OKX account so that you can continue with the task and eventually receive your commission on the fifth day. Unfortunately, you will never reach the fifth day, and they will continue to insist that you buy more USDT with false promises of substantial earnings. It is important to be aware of this scam and avoid falling victim to it.

Report_scams,PLEASE READ: Instagram has a major Pedo problem…,1dduz6z,Early-Parsnip6426,https://www.reddit.com/r/Report_scams/comments/1dduz6z/please_read_instagram_has_a_major_pedo_problem/,"Ik this isn’t necessarily a scam, but I tried to post this in other community’s and get auto banned. 

Over the last few days my instagram reels have gone from my normal interest and content to almost every 3-5 being little girls in super revealing clothing like bathing suits, underwear, and even lingerie doing gymnastics or even sexual dances and poses…. 

Most of these accounts aren’t even parents or children themselves. Some are but those “parents” are questionable as well because why would someone willingly post there under 10 (or any child under 18) twerking in g-strings and thongs, with in some cases parts of genitalia showing. But it’s mainly just creeps gathering these videos of different kids and posting them all on one page.
 
Why is any content of children in this manner allowed in the first place??? They have AI that can flag videos of people in car crashes and other gore but not this???

 This gets so much deeper and utterly worse though. In the comments of basically all these videos and bios of some of the accounts, they state things like “trade or buy sexy videos and pictures” (clearly talking about children) along with telegram accounts to contact them.

But by far the worst part is, the links…
This is where my curiosity took me way too deep. These links are to websites that contain massive amounts or literal CP. Not on the dark web either, the regular internet, but they are all foreign domain’s like “.ru” or “.in”. They even have fucking AD’S like it’s just any other porn site. I didn’t see much other than the first few images and auto playing videos on the sites but it was most disgusting and vile things I’ve ever seen in my fucking life. I genuinely have never felt so much hatred and depression from seeing something online. I’ve seen hundreds of gore and shock videos but literally none of those come close to comparison. 

This isn’t just some small issue either. Like I said for whatever reason more and more of these videos keep popping up in my reel feed and in all the comments there’s hundreds of people commenting how “hot” these kids are and what they would do with them, people talking about trades and sharing links. This is a huge community of people committing one of the worst acts humans can do and instagram seems to just allow it. I can’t get over how many people and accounts are involved in this. I’m really considering deleting my account. I don’t think I can live with being part of a platform that allows these kind of people to blatantly share CP…

Upon looking into this online it seems it’s been a problem for years now. There news articles talking about this exact thing dating back to 2016….
Also like I said most of the sites I looked at literally had adds for big companies… How is that getting approved but companies are picky about what people say in YouTube videos.

BTW If anyone is a “pedo hunter” on YouTube or any other social media PLEASE look into this and make a video or documentary. We need to blow this problem up so the world can see that meta is fine with this.
