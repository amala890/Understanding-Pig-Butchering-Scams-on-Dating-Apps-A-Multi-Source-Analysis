2024-11-28 08:20:11,"To all the guys out there hating on Tinder, I get that there are scam/spam profiles, and that’s a downside you’re going to find on pretty much any online dating app. If you know how to spot them, it’s not hard to weed them out. The majority of these reviews go on about there being unrealistic standards, having to be either rich, super attractive, or just a “top tier” man in order to get matches, but what do you actually expect? Work on yourself first, get your life together, build whatever it is that you can be proud of and confident in before putting any energy into a dating app. Those things will reflect in more ways than just online dating, and the rest will come later. If you really want to learn how to attract other women, there’s also plenty of resources out there that are available on how, even if you’re just average or below. Whether it’s for just passing the time or any other reasons you could be on this app for, this should never be priority in your life. I don’t think I’m top tier by any means, but I’ve met several women on here throughout the years, a couple of them turned into serious relationships, and I haven’t had any regrets. Asides from that, Tinder is the OG, I prefer its interface over other dating apps, and it works as advertised.",4,False,Look…,Dead1nside95,,True
2024-07-10 12:26:26,"Profiles are either fake or old or the people are genuinely not that serious about what they claim they are looking for. Seems as though they’re a lot of “look at me” profiles such as instathots , attention seekers, would be porn actresses and Escorts and women who constantly self sabotage themselves by acting as though they  cant be bothered with the app while simultaneously having a profile on the app stating that they are in fact looking. To send messages cost a fee, To see who likes you cost a fee, To boost cost a fee ….apparently one can actually run out of people within a 10 mile radius, which is odd considering the volume of people in my area.

Then after you actually meet someone as in have a convo they flake .In my honest opinion there should be a money back guarantee if a person cannot meet a person off this app..because its constantly taking money on a chance that you will meet someone and thats nothing more then a gamble… yes you can swipe through profiles but whats the point when there are sooo many obstacles put up in front of you then on top of that you have to pay fees for separate perks. Id say guys meet some one outside of the app or travel outside of the states  because the dating market is getting ridiculous at this point.",5,False,Scam/ waste of time,EdoKamiisama,,True
2024-08-31 14:30:16,"I’m not going to lie I’ve been lucky with this app in the past. I’ve dated a good number of people and made good friends off the app over the years, but recently? I’ve even seen women make fake account as men and get matches with people and it’s quite literally making them depressed and frustrated with the app and dislike women because their swipes literally mean nothing. If you do finally match it’s only ever one message and that’s it or it’s a bot. More often than not girls with social media in their bio are bots and are trying to sell OF and I’m just getting really frustrated with the whole premise. The idea behind online dating was to help those who would otherwise not have the opportunity to socialize or properly engage in courtship in a random setting. It’s supposed to be a tool to boost confidence and allow people to engage more. It’s literally now a hot or not app and profiles are literally being scooped off dead social media accounts- they have first and last names- and it’s genuinely not worth anyone’s time or money anymore. Do yourself a favor and save the time and money, find a way to get a Saturday/Friday night off, have *one* drink so your anxiety goes away and just start chatting with people at bars.

2024-09-27 18:58:34,"I do not recommend this app as it’s extremely low quality for dating prospects. So many nice profiles are fake accounts and scammers asking you to get on WhatsApp despite having a photo verified on their profile. Fake accounts of people who message you one thing and never respond again. Men desperate for hook ups that won’t try to get to know you unless they can get you to agree to a hook up before even meeting, very transactional mindsets. Then you have people who demand they’re catered to in their profile. After you filter through all of that the quality of people are really bad. If you find someone who knows how to keep a decent conversation going good luck because most do not have serious intentions of meeting. A good looking person with a personality with their stuff together is a rarity. I got tons of matches and thousands of likes but most profiles were fake or dead accounts. This is the worse this dating app has ever been. As I said before; most accounts are highly fake, you get the same cycle of people you swiped left on continuing to pop up and some people who are just plain weird. Most people you’re shown are not attractive. To get to a point where you’d even meet someone on this app is rare because of so many bad actors, scammers or someone trying to manipulate you.

To put it simply woman are delusional and disgusting I paid this app for quite some time and got nothing and to add to that I have gotten banned now three times and i think it’s because I look underage but I am an adult trying to find a woman to be my wife.

In my case I got banned for nothing because the worst message I sent was “hey cutie”. My roommate got banned even though he didn’t message ANYONE. When I went online I saw that this problem was prolific and everywhere. They ban people for absolutely no reason and without any proof. If they receive one report, you’re done.

Tinder steals your information and then blocks you from accessing your account. Tinder used to be a fun way to connect with people. It’s a complete joke. I’m not even sure the people i received support emails from are real people. The messages seemed very automated and fake. The prices are also outrages. Unless you pay out the Wazoo for likes you will not have fun on this app. I think it’s time to abandon online dating and meet people the traditional way.

2022-05-30 02:46:57,"I purchased a Tinder Platinum membership early this month during which I did not get any “likes” and that the same folks appeared to my screen for me to like or dislike their profiles over and over again. Then, I decided to cancel my subscription two weeks ago knowing that it will still be good until October 30, 2022 (I paid $110 Platinum good for 6 months). Yesterday, I tried to use the Tinder app only to find out that I have to create a new profile, which I did. Now my Platinum subscription is invalid. Also, all of a sudden I have “likes,” but of course I have to purchase Gold or Tinder plus or Platinum to view profiles of those who “liked” mine. I contacted Tinder and they told me to restore my purchase for me to view the profiles. Why do I have to restore my purchase when I have an active (Platinum) subscription which is good until October? Could someone tell me if this not a scam, which I totally believe it is!? I won’t be surprised if Tinder will be a subject of another Class Action like what happened in 12/21 because of its malpractice scamming people out of their money!",1,False,I have been scammed!,Mabistaka,,True
2021-04-28 01:15:17,"I was banned suddenly for absolutely no reason. My photos were appropriate, guys I spoke to told me they’d seen lots of overt boobage and advertising for OF on most of the girl’s accounts and I had none of that. One day without warning I received a banned notification. No warning, no suspension, just all the sudden banned. I reached out in the only available manner and received an email response saying they wouldn’t help me at all, just simply they don’t tolerate violating their terms, which I appreciate but I never did any of that (I even read it in depth to see if I may have violated something strange you’d never expect). They offered no direction or explain action on what might’ve happened. I even filed a complaint on the way they handled the matter. I had a paid account for 6 months as I’m a traveler and wanted to be able to change my location and meet people in different places (travel mode) and had 5 months left... I asked for refund but of course they didn’t even acknowledge that request. There is no way to call or dispute anything.

2023-01-23 02:24:07,"I’ve had this app for 7 years. I’ve noticed that the only time I match with someone is when I’m a good member. It’s like they purposely don’t show you people that liked you or vice versa that they will not show your profile when you swipe right. It seems to be a ploy to say “hey you have 8 matches waiting, upgrade”. Funny how I never get a like when I’m a paid member though. My mileage from location is way off. I see all these profiles that are supposedly within my set mileage limit. When you see where there from its hundreds of miles off. I’ve tried to delete my account and redo it. Still same issues. In 7 yrs, I think I matched with maybe 4 people. For the record, I know my limitations and don’t swipe on the fake models or woman out of my league. I believe I’ve swiped right to hundreds of profiles in the years and 4 matches (only when I’m a paid member) though. I’ve swiped left to hundreds as well.

2022-10-03 07:43:51,"The amount of 1 and 2 star reviews on here for the most part seem to be saying the same thing: bugs, scams, and ban issues and I’d say they’re accurate I bought tinder to try it and I’m not impressed I would lose matches that I was having good conversation with out of nowhere with no way to contact them anymore the app would show me people way out of my distance zone I would use the monthly boosts and do swipe surges only to get like 1 match on top of that the app is riddled with bots and scam accounts there seems to be an issue with the gender preference and worst of all you can’t even use the app without paying as a dude this app will likely only hurt your self esteem and as a female you’re likely going to get spammed and have to constantly dodge shady accounts if you want a date my best advice is to go somewhere and meet people because these dating apps aren’t worth your time and they’re certainly not worth your money until they fix the issues and I see other better reviews I won’t pay again.",2,False,Wouldn’t recommend,_CM44_,,True
2020-10-07 02:12:36,"Complete scam. I’ve been using the app on and off for 3 years and have. not. once. matched with a real person. It tells you you have multiple likes just to get you to spend money on gold, because it will never actually show you these accounts. I paid for gold for about 2 months last year and it was revealed that every account that had liked me was a bot account 1000+ miles away, and then I never got anymore likes after paying for the subscription. Used boosts, changed discovery settings, uploaded different pictures, changed bio, nothing. On top of that, it then banned me for no reason and customer service is non existent. 
I recently decided to give the app another try, a friend let me use their phone number to sign up, and it is the same exact thing. For 5-6 days it has been telling me I have 18 likes but no amount of swiping has given me a match or decreased the number of likes. It also starts to freeze and crashes if you swipe left more than 5 times in a row. Tinder only exists to get your hopes up and steal your money.

2023-06-28 04:29:27,"Most profiles are fake and response rate from those few matches are extremely low. When you report a fake profile nothing happens. During swiping, which takes forever, there are constant interruptions as they try to upsell you on new features. Many of these features used to be standard. Even with the expensive paid subscription, you get a few super likes then the offer to sell you more of them and tell you they have run out. Also there is no ability to select demographic dating preferences anymore even with the paid subscriptions. For example you can no longer include or exclude people in your dating results by listing your religious, cultural, racial, language preferences, political views, etc. This means hundreds of more swipes per day than before to filter through hundreds of people you may not prefer. It’s a shame these apps have fallen in quality and escalated in price. It’s really not worth anyone’s time or money anymore. There are so many things they can improve, but they don’t.

2022-07-15 18:39:35,"Tinder used to be the best dating app for meeting people online, Now its just flooded with fake profiles, bots, scammers, and women just trying to sell you their Onlyfans. It feels like there are no authentic profiles anymore. The few that there are Tinder pushes back on the algorithm so you are forced to pay for their premium services which have also gone up in price significantly and offer much less features. With the basic Gold profile you used to be able to see who swiped right on you and would get 5 super likes a day. Now neither of those features are included and instead are part of much more expensive packages. The once a month boost you would get is also gone. All of this to say that Tinder is dead for the regular users who actually liked the app for being able to connect and interact with people looking for the same thing as you. Its gone and probably never coming back. Other dating apps like Bumble and even Hinge are now much better for dating and meeting people.

Tinder please actually Investigate your reports because I believe for %110 I did nothing wrong. So, Why is it. That I have had my tinder account for 2-3 months normally but as soon as I get tinder platinum and start really using the service. Out of nowhere I amrandomly banded because some fake users wrongfully reported me. My messages are clean I know they are. I am verified. Im completely legit. Please tinder this has to be a glitch i literally just purchased tinder platinum. I had almost 80plus matches so much time wasted. So how am I supposed to make a tinder again if can’t use my number and I do not have a Facebook..... I guess I could use Instagram. But this is ridiculous. There’s no need for me to make another tinder account. I would really like to have an account with tinder again. That’s hard if my phones completely banned I can’t just go get another number. I already have a newer number. Tinder please review this and allow me to come back.",1,False,Banned for no reason,(Chap),,True
